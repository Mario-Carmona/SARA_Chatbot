# ds_config notes
#
# - enable bf16 if you use Ampere or higher GPU - this will run in mixed precision and will be
# faster.
#
# - for older GPUs you can enable fp16, but it'll only work for non-bf16 pretrained models - e.g.
# all official t5 models are bf16-pretrained
#
# - set offload_param.device to "none" or completely remove the `offload_param` section if you don't
# - want CPU offload
#
# - if using `offload_param` you can manually finetune stage3_param_persistence_threshold to control
# - which params should remain on gpus - the larger the value the smaller the offload size
#
