0,Algorithm,Algorithm Example,"An example of an algorithm in the field of cooking could be how to make croquettes. The steps of this algorithm would be as follows: Step 1: Chop the ham into small pieces, Step 2: Put in a frying pan a little butter, a tablespoon of flour..."
35,Algorithm,Definition of algorithm,The most commonly used definition of algorithm is the following: sequence of instructions to solve a problem.
36,Algorithm,Definition of algorithm,"An algorithm is a set of defined rules that allows a problem to be solved, in a certain way, by means of systematic (not necessarily ordered) and finite operations. These instructions, defined and ordered according to the data, solve the problem or task."
37,Algorithm,Characteristics of algorithms,"One of the characteristics of algorithms is that the instructions or rules are finite, i.e., there are a certain number of them."
38,Algorithm,Characteristics of algorithms,One of the characteristics of algorithms is that the rules that compose it are applied in an orderly fashion.
39,Algorithm,Characteristics of algorithms,One of the characteristics of algorithms is that algorithms always give a result at the end.
40,Algorithm,Characteristics of algorithms,"One of the characteristics of algorithms is that they are deterministic, that is, given the same data or input, the output is always the same."
50,Algorithm,Characteristics of algorithms,"One of the characteristics of algorithms is that they are complete, i.e., all possibilities of the problem must be considered in the solution."
51,Algorithm,Classification of algorithms,"Depending on the criterion used, different classifications are applied to algorithms. For example, if we use the classification by the system of signs with which the steps to be followed in the algorithm are described, we can differentiate two types, qualitative algorithms: those whose steps are verbal instructions and quantitative algorithms: those that follow instructions of numerical calculations."
52,Algorithm,Classification of algorithms,"If they are classified on the basis of their function, three main groups can be established such as search algorithms, sorting algorithms and routing algorithms."
53,Algorithm,Classification of algorithms,"The third criterion that can be used for their classification is based on their strategy to reach a result. In this group we can mention probabilistic, heuristic, greedy, scaling and deterministic algorithms."
41,Algorithm,Algorithm input,The input is the data on which the instructions are applied.
42,Algorithm,Algorithm input,An example of input in the field of cooking could be the ingredients of a recipe.
43,Algorithm,Algorithm input,An example of input in the field of computer science could be the web pages detected by the search engine spider.
44,Algorithm,Algorithm parts,"The parts of which an algorithm is composed are the inputs, the processing or instructions, and the outputs or the result obtained." 
45,Algorithm,Example of algorithm,"Google's PageRank algorithm is perhaps the best known algorithm in the digital world. Its function is to select the order of the links that appear when you insert a word or set of words in the search box. But in the king of search engines also operate other algorithms, less known, which are responsible for filtering the results by country of origin, language ... in addition to selecting what paid content (ads) each user sees at that time of day and for that keyword."
46,Algorithm,Example of algorithm,"Edgerank is the name of Facebook's algorithm and is responsible for determining which posts you see every time you access the social network. No, it's not about the latest ones that all your contacts have published, but about those that Edgerank thinks may be of interest to you. So if you haven't heard from your old classmate in a while, blame this algorithm."
47,Algorithm,Example of a recommendation algorithm,"Spotify, YouTube or Instagram also work with recommendation algorithms. On their success, i.e. how accurate they are in guessing what content users will like, depends not only the profitability of the brands that offer them, but also the user experience on the channel itself. If when you go into Spotify and click on the Radio option, songs that hurt your ears were playing, wouldn't you repeat?"
48,Algorithm,Algorithm History,"Humans have created, modified and used algorithms throughout history. More than 4500 years ago the Sumerians illustrated on clay tablets a repetitive method used to equally distribute the grain harvest among a varying number of men."
49,Algorithm,History of the algorithm,"Around 300 B.C. in Hellenistic Greece, the mathematician Euclid wrote 'Elements', a work that would lay the foundations for the geometry of the next millennia, that text includes his famous algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor."

2,Bot,Bot definition,"A bot is a computer program capable of performing repetitive tasks. It commonly operates on the Internet and usually simulates the behavior that a person would have, doing the same thing but automatically. Conversational bots that function as virtual assistants or chatbots are an example (Siri, Alexa, Cortana...). Another example are the bots in charge of performing the indexing of web pages, so that when you do a search you find what you want."
54,Bot,Bot definition,"A bot is a software application that is programmed to perform certain tasks. Bots are automated, meaning that they run according to your instructions without a human user having to manually launch them each time. Bots often mimic or replace the behavior of a human. They typically perform repetitive tasks and can do them much faster than people would."
55,Bot,Bot types,"Some types of bots are the following chat bots, web crawlers, social bots, malicious bots."
56,Bot,Bot example,"In the video game environment, a bot is a program that is capable of playing the game itself (also known as a borg). The quality of the bot in this case is determined by its ability to beat (and on what terms) the game. Bots for CRPG (computer role-playing games) games are particularly well known as these types of applications require a great capacity for strategy to win them. It is also very common to use this term in first-person shooter games, where they replace a human player when no opponents are available or in offline play." 
57,Bot,Bot example,"Bots used in political campaigns are called social bots, and are often used to generate content on social networks and thus generate or support certain ideas or influence political processes, for example by denigrating opposing candidates or to grow the popularity of a particular candidate in presidential or parliamentary elections. This political use of the bot that generates content on the Internet has a growing presence around the world, and various studies have found that the percentage of activity generated by bots during elections in many cases exceeds 10% of the publications made."
3,Big data,Big data definition,"Big Data refers to a large amount of data, both structured and unstructured, that cannot be analyzed by conventional algorithms. Think of the DNA of the organisms that inhabit our planet, or the number of TikTok videos that are posted every day. Conventional algorithms get ""choked"" with so much data and different algorithms and strategies need to be used." 
58,Big data,Definition of big data,"The term 'big data' refers to data that is so big, or complex that are difficult or impossible to process with traditional methods. The act ofaccessing and storing large amounts of information for analytics has been around for a long time."
59,Big data,Big data usage,"What makes Big Data so useful for many companies is the fact that it provides answers to many questions that companies didn't even know they had. In other words, it provides a benchmark. With such a large amount of information, the data can be shaped or tested in any way the company sees fit. In doing so, organizations are able to identify problems in a more understandable way."
4,Reinforcement learning,Definition of reinforcement learning,"Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning whereby a decision made by an algorithm is followed by a reinforcement (positive or negative). This 'encourages' or 'punishes' these decisions allowing the algorithm to learn. This type of learning is typically used in robotics. It could be used to teach a robotic arm to pour drinks, giving positive reinforcement when it succeeds in pouring a drink and negative reinforcement when."
60,Reinforcement learning,Definition of reinforcement learning,"Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning inspired by behavioral psychology, whose occupation is to determine what actions a software agent should choose in a given environment in order to maximize some notion of ""reward"" or accrued reward."
61,Reinforcement Learning,Functionality of Reinforcement Learning,"In Reinforcement Learning we do not have an 'output label', so it is not supervised and although these algorithms learn by themselves, they are not unsupervised, where we try to classify groups taking into account some distance between samples."
62,Reinforcement learning,Examples of reinforcement learning,"Reinforcement learning can be used in robots, for example in mechanical arms where instead of teaching instruction by instruction to move, we can let it make 'blind' attempts and reward it when it does well."
63,Reinforcement learning,Reinforcement learning examples,Reinforcement learning can be used to create "personalized websites" for each user. And if you think about it... it makes some sense to take the concept of "rewarding" the algorithm if it is right with the suggestions it makes to the user if he clicks or penalizing the model if its recommendations are not useful.
64,Reinforcement learning,Examples of reinforcement learning,Reinforcement learning can be used to decide how to shape an investment portfolio without human intervention.

6,Metaverse,Definition of metaverse,"A metaverse is a universe created in cyberspace. These universes could be accessed with virtual reality and in which, ideally, it should be possible to travel through different experiences in a shared way with millions of users. First attempts at metaverses could be Roblox, Fortnite or Animal Crossing: New Horizons. These new metaverses are still being imagined... it is a new field to explore and soon we will have countless universes to ""live"" in."
69,Metaverse,Definition of metaverse,"The Metaverse is a virtual world, one to which we will connect using a series of devices that will make us think that we are really inside it, interacting with all its elements. It will be like actually teleporting to a whole new world through virtual reality glasses and other complements that will allow us to interact with it."
70,Metaverse,Definition of metaverse,"The term metaverse comes from a 1992 novel called 'Snow Crash,' and is a term that has settled to describe visions of three-dimensional or virtual workspaces. This metaverse, therefore, means a virtual world in which we can interact, and which has been created to resemble an external reality." 
71,Metaverse,Example of metaverse,"Video calls, which after the pandemic have become so popular, could in the future be replaced by virtual meetings in the metaverse. That is, instead of connecting our cameras we would see how our avatars meet."
72,Metaverse,Example of metaverse,"The possibility of testing the operation of new machines or systems very reliably before final manufacture, with the consequent saving of billions of euros in tests before the launch of a new patent."

8,Federated learning,Definition of federated learning,"Federated learning is a machine learning technique that allows to train an algorithm in a decentralized way,using their own (private and local) data. It is also known as Collaborative Learning, as each user learns a model with their own data, but only shares this model (data remains private) with other users."
79,Federated learning,Example of federated learning,"The technique can train an algorithm with data stored in multiple different hospitals without that data leaving their facilities or having to be copied to a technology company's servers. To do this, separate models at each hospital must first be trained on the available local data. Then, all the models are sent to a central server where they are combined into a master model. As each hospital acquires more data, it can download the latest master model, update it with its new information and send it back to the central server. During this process, the raw data is never exchanged; the only thing that is transferred is the algorithms, which cannot be reverse-engineered to reveal that data."
9,Data science,Definition of data science,Data science encompasses tools that enable useful information to be extracted from data sets. It mainly includes statistics and computer science (specifically data mining and machine learning techniques). It has become very popular since the concept of Big Data was coined.

11,Overfitting,Definition of overfitting,"Overfitting is the consequence of creating a pattern that fits a set of examples so very, very well that when you present it with new examples that are slightly different, it is unable to identify them. It fails to generalize the learned pattern. Imagine that you generate a model (a neural network, for example) based on many images of white, brown and orange cats. When you give it a new image of a cat with those colors, it identifies it correctly as a cat, but if you give it an image of a black cat... it will tell you that it is not a cat at all..."
86,Overfitting,Definition of overfitting,Overfitting is the act of making a model so tight to the training data that it does not generalize well to the test data.
87,Overfitting,Definition of overfitting,"Overfitting occurs when a machine learning system is overtrained or overtrained with anomalous data, which causes the algorithm to 'learn' patterns that are not general. It learns specific features but not the general patterns, the concept. More complex models tend to overfit more than simpler models. Also, given the same model, the smaller the amount of data, the more likely that model is to overfit."
12,Underfitting,Definition of underfitting,"It is hardly ever talked about, but it does exist. It happens when a too simple model is generated, unable to work even with the set of examples with which it is generated. It fails to identify a pattern. It may happen that you do not have enough data to generate the model. But don't worry... there are ways around this. For example, you can adjust the parameters of the algorithm you are using or try another type of algorithm that better fits the data."
88,Underfitting,Definition of underfitting,Underfitting refers to the failure of our model to generalize the knowledge we intend them to acquire.
89,Underfitting,Cause of underfitting,If our training data are too few our machine will not be able to generalize the knowledge and will be incurring in an underfitting.

14,Model,Model definition,"All models in AI generally learn a function F that relates the input values x and the output values y. y = F(x). The model is a representation of the x values that have been used to train it. The more accurate the model, the better it will represent these values and thus be a better predictor when faced with new examples."

94,Model,Model definition,"A machine learning model is a file that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. You can train a model with a set of data, and provide it with an algorithm that it can use to find out and get information from that data."
95,Model,Definition of model,"A model is an analytical method that allows a system, by itself, without human intervention and in an automated way, to learn to discover patterns, trends and relationships in the data, and thanks to this knowledge, in each interaction with new information, better perspectives are offered."
15,Generative models,Definition of generative models,"Generative models are so called because they generate new examples, similar to those of the data set they were trained on. They are also known as Generative Antagonistic Networks or GANs.English). They are basically two models (artificial neural networks) that compete with each other: one generates new examples and the other tries to discriminate between real and synthetic examples. Gradual y the generator becomes so good that the discriminator is unable to distinguish fact from fiction."
96,Generative models,Definition of generative models,"A generative model is a deep architecture endowed with learning algorithms whose mission is to learn any type of data distribution, all this applied within the unsupervised learning paradigm."
97,Generative models,Definition of generative models,"Generative models allow a machine to 'learn' the patterns that exist in the data they are trained on and from that learning, they are able to generate similar data that in some cases can be almost as 'real' as that which was initially used for training."
98,Generative models,Example of generative models,"In particular, Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GAN's) can generate new images that look like or are similar to the images they were trained with, but are individually different from all of them." 
16,Graph,Definition of graph,"You can represent a problem as a graph, for example, the connection between people in a social network.

A tree that is not empty consists of a root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes that form a hierarchy."
102,Tree,Tree definition,"Trees are the most used data structures, but also one of the most complex, Trees are characterized by storing their nodes in a hierarchical way and not in a linear way as the Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, etc., of which we have already talked about in the past days."
103,Tree,Definition of tree,"Trees are undoubtedly one of the nonlinear data structures, used in computing, both to solve hardware and software problems. Directory trees are quite commonly used organizations by any computer user or programmer."
18,Decision tree,Definition of decision tree,"It is the representation of a set of rules for making a decision. There is a learning model that learns these rules based on examples. The trick is to identify those decisions that best divide the set of examples. For example, if we have to classify a shopping basket into a Christmas basket or a normal basket, whether a sweet bread or a nougat is inside is almost decisive. The more relevant decisions will be higher up in the hierarchy of the resulting tree."
104,Decision tree,Definition of decision tree,A decision tree is a prediction model used in various fields ranging from artificial intelligence to economics. 
105,Decision tree,Definition of decision tree,"A decision tree diagram allows you to evaluate through a graphical representation the possible outcomes, costs and consequences of a decision tree.of a complex decision. This method is very useful for analyzing quantitative data and making a decision based on numbers."
19,Association rules,Definition of association rules,"Association rules are logical implications of the type 'If X, then Y'. They can be obtained from a decision tree or deduced directly from the training set. For example, if we have a data set with information of the height (X), width (Y) and depth (Z) of an object and we want to classify it as large or small we can have rules like: If (X > 20) then large, If (X <= 20) then small, If (X > 10) and (Y>10) then large."
106,Association rules,Definition of association rules,"An association rule is defined as an implication of the type 'if X then Y', where X and Y are itemsets or individual items. The left-hand side of the rule is called the antecedent or lenft-hand-side (LHS) and the right-hand side is called the consequent or right-hand-side (RHS)."
107,Association rules,Example of association rules,"Learning association rules tells us that if a user buys, for example, a book, how likely it is that he will buy another book, where these two books are related because other users bought them both." 
20,Prolog,Definition of Prolog,"Prolog is an interpreted programming language developed in France in the '70s. In this language there are two types of clauses: Facts and Rules. Facts are always true, while Rules define a relationship between different Facts and/or Rules.

124,Turing complete,Definition of turing complete,"A system is said to be ""Turing complete"" in computer theory if it can be used to emulate a Turing machine, which is a theoretical construct designed by the mid-century mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing."
28,Smart data,Definition of smart data,"Smart data refers to data that has been preprocessed and curated. This data is ready to be used, i.e. Machine Learning algorithms can be applied directly to it. We refer to big data when we perform raw data mining, in particular when we collect a large amount of data. Smart data, on the other hand, also collects a large amount of data, but also includes the added value of analyzing this data."
125,Smart data,Definition of smart data,"We all know what Big Data is, it refers to the large volume of data that can be collected. On the other hand, Smart Data also collects a lot of data instantly, but in this case it has an added value compared to the first one, and that is that in addition to collecting a lot of information, the system is also capable of analyzing it."
126,Smart data,Definition of smart data,"Smart Data appears as a result of Big Data. The concept of Smart Data refers to transforming long lists of numbers and data into valuable, responsive, useful information. Turning data into statistics using complicated algorithms that process Big data."
29,Metadata,Definition of metadata,"Metadata is information that accompanies the data itself. For example, when you take a photograph, the image itself is accompanied by metadata that includes information about who the author is, his/her GPS position, the date and time, etc. Metadata can be: Descriptive such as EXIF data, Administrative such as copyright, Structural related to other data, Language such as XML" 
127,Metadata,Definition of metadata,"Metadata is data about data. In other words, it is information that is used to describe the data contained in something such as a web page, document or file. Another way to think of metadata is as a brief explanation or summary of what the data is."
128,Metadata,Metadata definition,"Metadata is data that describes other data. In general, a group of metadata refers to a group of data that describe the contentinformation about an object that is referred to as a resource. The concept of metadata is analogous to the use of indexes to locate objects rather than data."
30,Hash Function,Hash Function Definition,"A Hash Function or Digest Function is a mathematical function that transforms a set of data into an alphanumeric code of fixed length. Regardless of the amount of data used, the resulting code will always have the same number of characters. Hash functions are used in cryptography (e.g., digital signature), random number generation, text search systems, and much more. Hash functions are also part of data structures used in many artificial intelligence algorithms."
129,Hash function,Hash function definition,"A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical algorithm that transforms any arbitrary block of data into a new series of characters with a fixed length. Regardless of the length of the input data, the output hash value will always have the same length."
130,Hash function,Hash function definition,"A hash function, also known by the hybrid hash function, converts one or more input elements to a function into another element. They are also known as extract function, from digest function, extract function and by the hybrid digest function."
31,Hash table,Hash table definition,"A hash table is a data structure that relates a value called 'key' to one or more other elements. It has the particularity of performing very fast search operations thanks to the use of hash functions. The keys of the hash table are encoded in such a way that there is only one possible place within the structure where each piece of data can be stored. So, searching for it is a matter of applying a mathematical function and going to look for the data where indicated."
131,Hash table,Hash table definition,"A hash table, associative array, hashing, hash map, hash map, scatter table or fragmented table is a data structure that associates keys or keys with values. The main operation it efficiently supports is lookup: it allows access to stored items from a generated key."
132,Hash table,Definition of hash table,"Hash tables are data structures that are used to store a large number of data over which very efficient search and insert operations are required. A hash table stores a set of '(key, value)' pairs." 
32,Merkle Tree,Definition of Merkle tree,"A Hash Tree or Merkle Tree is a tree-like data structure in which: A) Each leaf node is labeled with the result of applying a Hash Function to the data corresponding to that leaf. A) Each internal node is labeled with the result of applying a Hash Function to the concatenation of the labels of its descendant nodes. Merkle Trees are used to record peer-to-peer transactions, Blockchain type. But don't worry, I'll soon make a video explaining how they work..."
133,Merkle tree,Merkle tree definition,"A Merkle hash tree or Merkle tree or hash tree is a tree-like data structure, binary or otherwise, in which each non-leaf node is labeled with the hash of the concatenation of the labels or values of its child nodes. They are a generalization of hash lists and hash chains."
134,Merkle tree,Definition of Merkle tree,Merkle trees are a data structure created with the objective of facilitating the verification of large amounts of organized data by relating them by means of various cryptographic and information management techniques. 
33,Dummy variables,Definition of dummy variables,"A Dummy Variable is a variable that is created when the original variable cannot be used. For example, if we have a categorical variable such as ""color"" (which can take values ""green"", ""blue"" or ""red"") and we want to measure distances between different instances, we will have to convert it into numeric values. One option is to use one-hot encoding and convert the variable ""color"" into three new dummy variables (one per color). These three variables will be binary and can take the value of 0 or 1, but only one of these three variables will be 1 at a time. This way we can compare colors using a hamming distance."
135,Dummy variables,Definition of dummy variables,Dummy or indicator variables are used to identify categories or classes to which the observations belong.
136,Dummy variables,Definition of dummy variables,"In statistics and econometrics, particularly in regression analysis, a dummy variable is one that takes only the value 0 or 1 to indicate the absence or presence of some categorical effect that can be expected to change the outcome."
34,Intelligent agent,Definition of intelligent agent,"An intelligent agent is a program with at least the following characteristics: autonomous, sociable, responsive, self-initiated. There are different types of intelligent agents and even multi-agent systems, where several agents cooperate to achieve a common goal. An example of intelligent agents are vacuum cleaner robots. Some are so smart that they can create a map of your home so they don't always go through the same place and make sure your whole house is clean."
137,Intelligent agent,Definition of intelligent agent,"An intelligent agent, is an entity capable of perceiving its environment, processing such perceptions and responding or acting in its environment rationally, i.e., in a correct manner and tending to maximize an expected result."
138,Intelligent agent,Definition of intelligent agent,"An intelligent agent is a perceptual system capable of interpreting and processing the information it receives from its environment, acting accordingly according to the data it collects and processes. The way this entity acts is logical and rational based on the reactions of the normal behavior of a particular system. It uses sensors to receive information and actuators to exercise its functions."
