The quality of the bot in this case is determined by its ability to beat (and on what terms) the game. Bots for CRPG (computer role-playing games) games are particularly well known as these types of applications require a great capacity for strategy to win them. It is also very common to use this term in first-person shooter games, where they replace a human player when no opponents are available or in offline play. "

115,Smart data,Definición de smart data,"Smart data refers to data that has been preprocessed and curated. This data is ready to be used, i.e. Machine Learning algorithms can be applied directly to it. We refer to big data when we perform raw data mining, in particular when we collect a large amount of data. Smart data, on the other hand, also collects a large amount of data, but also includes the added value of analyzing this data."
116,Smart data,Definición de smart data,"We all know what Big Data is, it refers to the large volume of data that can be collected. On the other hand, Smart Data also collects a lot of data instantly, but in this case it has an added value compared to the first one, and that is that in addition to collecting a lot of information, the system is also capable of analyzing it."
117,Sugar code,Definición de sugar code,"Sugar coding is a term that refers to the elements added to a programming language to make its programming simpler (i.e., sweeter), without affecting its functionality. A) a = a + 1 can be written as a += 1. B) 1 < x and x < 10 can be written as 1 < x < 10. C) number = 1000000000 can be written as number = 1_000_000_000_000."
118,Árbol,Definición de árbol,"Trees are undoubtedly one of the nonlinear data structures, used in computing, both to solve hardware and software problems. Directory trees are quite commonly used organizations by any computer user or programmer."
119,Árbol,Definición de árbol,"A tree is a (possibly nonlinear) data structure composed of nodes, vertices and edges that is acyclic. A tree that has no nodes is called an empty or null tree. A tree that is not empty consists of a root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes that form a hierarchy."
120,Árbol,Definición de árbol,"A tree is a data structure. It is a type of network with a hierarchical structure, like a tree in nature. It has the particularity of not having cycles. Using this data structure it is easier to solve some common problems such as: Prefix search in character strings, Representation of mathematical formulas, HTML representation, Decision making. And much more!"
121,Árbol,Definición de árbol,"Trees are the most used data structures, but also one of the most complex, Trees are characterized by storing their nodes in a hierarchical way and not in a linear way as the Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, etc., of which we have already talked about in the past days."
122,Máquina de Turing,Definición de máquina de Turing,"A Turing machine consists of an infinite tape divided into juxtaposed workspaces or cells that acts as memory, a head capable of reading and writing symbols on the tape and moving it from cell to cell right and left, a state register, and a finite instruction table or action table. "
123,Turing completo,Definición de turing completo,"By Turing complete we mean that language which has a computational power equivalent to what is called the Universal Turing Machine. In other words, Alan Turing devised a system that could theoretically perform any kind of computation if unlimited physical resources were available."
124,Turing completo,Definición de turing completo,"A Turing Complete system is one that has a computational power equivalent to the Universal Turing Machine. In other words, a Turing Complete system can emulate a Universal Turing Machine and vice versa. As you will see, computer scientists and mathematicians also philosophize... Some examples are Lambda Calculus (type-free), Cellular Automata, Quantum Computers, Formal Grammars, and many others... "
125,Turing completo,Definición de turing completo,"A system is said to be ""Turing complete"" in computer theory if it can be used to emulate a Turing machine, which is a theoretical construct designed by the mid-century mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing."
126,Máquina de Turing,Definición de máquina de Turing,The Turing machine is a mental device devised by Alan Turing in the 1930s to answer one of the great questions posed by the mathematician David Hilbert in 1900.
127,Máquina de Turing,Definición de máquina de Turing,"The Turing machine is a device created in 1936, which represents an idealized model of computing capable of storing/processing virtually infinite information. The system is a mathematical abstraction that is constructed in an extraordinarily simple way, but which facilitates the empirical verification of a wide range of questions on the theories of computability and/or complexity. Its ideation marked a major milestone in the history of computing, to the point of being considered as the origin of today's computers (and related technologies, such as tablets or cell phones). "
128,Máquina de Turing,Definición de máquina de Turing,A Turing machine is a device that uses a table of rules to manipulate symbols on a data tape. A Turing machine is a formal model of computation capable of performing any computation (that a computer is capable of performing). Thanks to this theoretical model it is possible to categorize computational problems according to their complexity: A) Complexity P: Its solutions can be found in polynomial time by deterministic Turing machines. B) NP Complexity: Their solutions can be found in polynomial time by non-deterministic Turing machines.
129,Test de Turing,Definición de test de Turing,"The Turing test consists of a human having a conversation with a computer and another person, but without knowing which of the two conversationalists is actually a machine. The goal of this experiment is to determine whether artificial intelligence can mimic human responses."
130,Test de Turing,Definición de test de Turing,The Turing test or Turing test is an examination of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior similar to or indistinguishable from that of a human being.
131,Test de Turing,Definición de test de Turing,"The Turing test is a test to measure the intelligence of a machine. It consists of asking a machine and a human a series of questions. If the questioner is not able to distinguish who is the human and who is the machine, then the latter is said to be intelligent and to have passed the test. In 2014 an AI called Eugene was said to have passed the test, but it had only convinced 30% of the judges.... So I would say that no machine capable of completely fooling a human by impersonating someone of the same species has yet been developed."
132,Subajuste,Definición de subajuste,"It is hardly ever talked about, but it does exist. It happens when a too simple model is generated, unable to work even with the set of examples with which it is generated. It fails to identify a pattern. It may happen that you do not have enough data to generate the model. But don't worry... there are ways around this. For example, you can adjust the parameters of the algorithm you are using or try another type of algorithm that better fits the data."
133,Subajuste,Causa de subajuste,"If our training data are too few our machine will not be able to generalize the knowledge and will be incurring in an underfitting. "
134,Subajuste,Definición de subajuste,Underfitting refers to the failure of our model to generalize the knowledge we intend them to acquire.
135,Xenobot,Historia de xenobot,"The xenobot has been designed by a supercomputer called Deep Green which is located at the University of Vermont, although they have subsequently been developed at the Biology Laboratory at Tufts University in Massachusetts. "
136,Xenobot,Definición de xenobot,A xenobot is a robot that has been obtained from frog embryos through a sophisticated technological process. It is a historical milestone as it represents the first robot or biological machine that has been designed from scratch from a living organic matter.
137,Xenobot,Definición de xenobot,"A xenobot is a synthetic biological entity created from cells of embryos of the species Xenopus laevis, designed by a supercomputer specialized in determining configurations of its structure to provide it with specific properties that allow them to have programmed behaviors."
138,Xenobot,Definición de xenobot,"Xenobots (also called biobots) are half animal and half robots. They are the first self-replicating living robots. They were created thanks to African clawed frog embryo cells, and have been designed with a computer from specific biological building blocks based on an evolutionary algorithm. They are like little Pac- Man."
