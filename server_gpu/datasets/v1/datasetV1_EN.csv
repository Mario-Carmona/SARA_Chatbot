0,Aprendizaje automático,Automatic learning,"Machine learning is a branch within AI that allows a computer to learn based on examples. They can be grouped into: Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-supervised."
0,Bot,Bot,"A bot is a computer program capable of performing repetitive tasks. It commonly operates on the Internet and usually simulates the behavior that a person would have, doing the same thing but automatically. Conversational bots that function as virtual assistants or chatbots are an example (Siri, Alexa, Cortana...). Another example is the bots in charge of indexing web pages, so that when you do a search you find what you want."
0,Big data,Big data,"Big Data refers to a large amount of data, both structured and unstructured, that cannot be analyzed by conventional algorithms. Think of the DNA of the organisms that inhabit our planet, or the number of TikTok videos that are posted every day. Conventional algorithms get ""choked"" with so much data and it is necessary to use different algorithms and strategies."
0,Aprendizaje por refuerzo,Reinforcement learning,"Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning whereby a decision made by an algorithm is followed by a reinforcement (positive or negative). This ""encourages"" or ""punishes"" these decisions allowing the algorithm to learn. This type of learning is typically used in robotics. It could be used to teach a robotic arm to pour drinks, giving positive reinforcement when it succeeds in pouring a drink and negative reinforcement when it fails."
0,Internet de las Cosas (IoT),Internet of Things (IoT),The Internet of Things is a concept that refers to a digital interconnection of everyday objects with the Internet. It is a new paradigm in which different devices interact with each other without human intervention. An example of IoT use are the activity bracelets that can be used in Connected Health issues to know the status of a person. It could detect if you are a sleepwalker...
0,Metaverso,Metaverse,"A metaverse is a universe created in cyberspace. These universes could be accessed with virtual reality and, ideally, one should be able to travel through different experiences shared with millions of users. First attempts at metaverses could be Roblox, Fortnite or Animal Crossing: New Horizons. These new metaverses are still being imagined... it is a new field to explore and soon we will have countless universes to ""live"" in."
0,Blockchain,Blockchain,"Blockchain is a system for digital transfer based on the distribution of information in several independent computers that register and validate such information, eliminating intermediaries. If we talk about bank transfers, these could be done without the need for a centralized computer (a bank)."
0,Aprendizaje federado,Federated learning,"Federated Learning is a machine learning technique that allows to train an algorithm in a decentralized way, using its own data (private and local). It is also known as Collaborative Learning, since each user learns a model with its own data, but only shares this model (the data remains private) with other users."
0,Ciencia de datos,Data science,Data Science encompasses tools that allow useful information to be extracted from data sets. It mainly includes statistics and computer science (specifically data mining and machine learning techniques). It has become very popular since the concept of Big Data was coined. Data scientists constitute a new academic profile. There are several master's degrees that specialize in Data Science and it is likely that soon there will also be specific degree programs...
0,Computación Ecológica,Green Computing,"Green Computing refers to computing that makes responsible use of resources. It attempts, for example, to minimize energy use, making efficient use of energy and reducing environmental impact. One idea to be ""greener"" is to have a data center that can be used by several researchers and thus make better use of resources without the need to duplicate them. For this, it is essential to have a good communications network to connect them."
0,Sobreajuste,Overadjustment,"Overfitting is the consequence of creating a model that fits a set of examples so well that when you present it with new examples that are slightly different, it is unable to identify them. It fails to generalize the learned pattern. Imagine that you generate a model (a neural network, for example) based on many images of white, brown and orange cats. When you give it a new image of a cat with those colors, it identifies it correctly as a cat, but if you give it an image of a black cat... it will tell you that it is not a cat at all..."
0,Subajuste,Subajuste,"It is hardly ever talked about, but yes, it does exist. It happens when you generate a model that is too simple, unable to work even with the set of examples with which it is generated. It fails to identify a pattern. It may happen that you do not have enough data to generate the model. But don't worry... there are ways around this. For example, you can adjust the parameters of the algorithm you are using or try another type of algorithm that better fits the data."
0,Realidad aumentada,Augmented reality,"Augmented Reality is the set of technologies that allow visualizing, through some kind of device, the real world with some ""extras"". These extras can be graphics, photos or videos, interactive or not, that add information to what a human being would normally see. It differs from Virtual Reality in that the latter does not incorporate real elements, it is completely virtual, in the sense that what is seen is generated by a computer."
0,Modelo,Model,"All models in AI generally learn a function F that relates the input values x and the output values y. y = F(x). The model is a representation of the x values that have been used to train it. The more accurate the model is, the better it will represent these values and thus be a better predictor of new examples."
0,Modelos generativos,Generative models,"Generative models are so called because they generate new examples, similar to those of the data set with which they were trained. They are also known as Generative Antagonistic Networks or GANs. They are basically two models (artificial neural networks) that compete with each other: one generates new examples and the other tries to discriminate between real and synthetic examples. Gradually the generator becomes so good that the discriminator is unable to distinguish fact from fiction."
0,Grafo,Grafo,"You can represent a problem as a graph, for example, the connection between people in a social network. Each point in the graph is a person and the lines connecting them represent friendships. Using that data structure it is possible to apply specific graph theory algorithms to: Detect communities, Identify influential people, Measure the popularity of a person, Detect who controls the flow of information. and much more!"
0,Árbol,Tree,"A tree is a data structure. It is a type of network with a hierarchical structure, like a tree in nature. It has the particularity of not having cycles. Using this data structure it is easier to solve some common problems such as: Prefix search in character strings, Representation of mathematical formulas, HTML representation, Decision making, and much more!"
0,Árbol de decisión,Decision tree,"It is the representation of a set of rules for making a decision. There is a learning model that learns these rules based on examples. The trick is to identify those decisions that best divide the set of examples. For example, if we have to classify a shopping basket into a Christmas basket or a normal basket, whether a sweet bread or a nougat is inside is almost decisive. The most relevant decisions will be higher in the hierarchy of the resulting tree."
0,Reglas de asociación,Rules of association,"Association rules are logical implications of the type ""If X, then Y"". They can be obtained from a decision tree or deduced directly from the training set. For example, if we have a data set with information about the height (X), width (Y) and depth (Z) of an object and we want to classify it as large or small we can have rules like: If (X > 20) then large, If (X <= 20) then small, If (X > 10) and (Y>10) then large."
0,Prolog,Prologue,"Prolog is an interpreted programming language developed in France in the 1970s. In this language there are two types of clauses: Facts and Rules. Facts are always true, while Rules define a relationship between different Facts and/or Rules. Here is how to solve in PROLOG a factorial with two Facts and a Rule:\nfactorial(0, 1).\nfactorial(1, 1).\nfactorial(N, F) :- \n N>0, \n N1 is N - 1,\nfactorial(N1, F1),\n F is N * F1."
0,Sugar code,Sugar code,"Sugar coding is a term that refers to elements added to a programming language to make its programming simpler (i.e., sweeter), without affecting its functionality. A) a = a + 1 can be written as a += 1. B) 1 < x and x < 10 can be written as 1 < x < 10. C) number = 1000000000 can be written as number = 1_000_000_000_000."
0,Autoencoder,Autoencoder,Autoencoders are a particular type of artificial neural network that is divided into two parts: the encoder and the decoder. They function like a normal multilayer neural network and are used to learn efficient encodings from unlabeled data. The hidden layers of the network get smaller and smaller in the encoder portion and then grow again in the decoder. The idea is to be able to reduce the amount of information needed to represent the information. This minimal portion of data is used to reconstruct the input signal in the decoding phase.
0,Unidad de Procesamiento Gráfico (GPU),Graphics Processing Unit (GPU),"GPUs are like CPUs but for graphics. They are mathematical co-processors designed for graphics processing and floating point operations. That is, they help the CPU to process everything related to 3D applications, video games, ... Graphics cards that are used for something other than graphics processing are called GP-GPUs or general purpose GPUs. These GPUs are capable of processing numerical calculations much faster than the CPU and can work in parallel. They have been to blame for the boom of the whole topic around Deep Learning."
0,Xenobot,Xenobot,"Xenobots (also called biobots) are half animal and half robot. They are the first self-replicating living robots. They were created thanks to African clawed frog embryo cells, and have been designed with a computer from specific biological building blocks based on an evolutionary algorithm. They are like little Pac-Men."
0,Máquina de Turing,Turing Machine,A Turing Machine is a device that uses a table of rules to manipulate symbols on a data tape. A Turing machine is a formal model of computation capable of performing any computation (that a computer is capable of performing). Thanks to this theoretical model it is possible to categorize computational problems according to their complexity: A) Complexity P: Its solutions can be found in polynomial time by deterministic Turing machines. B) NP Complexity: Their solutions can be found in polynomial time by non-deterministic Turing machines.
0,Test de Turing,Test the Turing,"The Turing Test is a test to measure the intelligence of a machine. It consists of asking a machine and a human a series of questions. If the questioner is not able to distinguish who is the human and who is the machine, then the latter is said to be intelligent and to have passed the test. In 2014 an AI called Eugene was said to have passed the test, but it had only convinced 30% of the judges.... So I would say that no machine capable of completely fooling a human by impersonating someone of the same species has yet been developed."
0,Turing completo,Turing completo,"A Turing Complete system is one that has a computational power equivalent to the Universal Turing Machine. In other words, a Turing Complete system can emulate a Universal Turing Machine and vice versa. As you will see, computer scientists and mathematicians also philosophize... Some examples are Lambda Calculus (type-free), Cellular Automata, Quantum Computers, Formal Grammars, and many others..."
0,Smart data,Smart data,"Smart data refers to data that has been preprocessed and curated. This data is ready to be used, i.e. Machine Learning algorithms can be applied directly to it. We refer to big data when we perform raw data mining, in particular when we collect a large amount of data. Smart data, on the other hand, also collects a large amount of data, but also includes the added value of analyzing this data."
0,Metadatos,Metadata,"Metadata is information that accompanies the data itself. For example, when you take a photograph, the image itself is accompanied by metadata that includes information about who the author is, their GPS position, the date and time, etc. Metadata can be: Descriptive such as EXIF data, Administrative such as copyright, Structural related to other data, Language such as XML."
0,Función Hash,Hash function,"A Hash Function or Summary Function is a mathematical function that transforms a set of data into an alphanumeric code of fixed length. Regardless of the amount of data used, the resulting code will always have the same number of characters. Hash functions are used in cryptography (e.g., digital signature), random number generation, text search systems, and much more. Hash functions are also part of data structures used in many artificial intelligence algorithms."
0,Tabla Hash,Hash Table,"A Hash Table is a data structure that relates a value called ""key"" to one or more other elements. It has the particularity of performing very fast lookup operations thanks to the use of hash functions. The keys of the hash table are encoded in such a way that there is only one possible place within the structure where each piece of data can be stored. Thus, searching for it is a matter of applying a mathematical function and going to look for the data where indicated."
0,Árbol de Merkle,Árbol de Merkle,"A Hash Tree or Merkle Tree is a tree-like data structure in which: A) Each leaf node is labeled with the result of applying a Hash Function to the data corresponding to that leaf. A) Each internal node is labeled with the result of applying a Hash Function to the concatenation of the labels of its descendant nodes. Merkle Trees are used to record peer-to-peer transactions, Blockchain type. But don't worry, I'll make you a video explaining how they work soon..."
0,Variables dummy,Variables dummy,"A Dummy Variable is a variable that is created when the original variable cannot be used. For example, if we have a categorical variable such as ""color"" (which can take values ""green"", ""blue"" or ""red"") and we want to measure distances between different instances, we will have to convert it into numeric values. One option is to use one-hot coding and convert the variable ""color"" into three new dummy variables (one per color). These three variables will be binary and can take the value of 0 or 1, but only one of these three variables will be 1 at a time. This way we can compare colors using a hamming distance."
0,Agente inteligente,Intelligent agent,"An Intelligent Agent is a program with at least the following characteristics: autonomous, sociable, responsive, self-initiated. There are different types of intelligent agents and even multi-agent systems, where several agents cooperate to achieve a common goal. An example of intelligent agents are vacuum cleaner robots. Some are so smart that they can create a map of your home so that they don't always go through the same place and make sure that your whole house is clean."
