"Cloud Computing","Cloud Computing","What are some programming strategies that I can make to cut down on my cloud bill?","There is a number of strategies you can apply, like asserting performance efficiency but also using cost optimizing features of the cloud provider. Not all of these strategies have a direct relationship with software development/programming as there are additional ways to cut your cloud bill and only looking at software development would limit your capability to cut down cloud costs. This article provides an overview of some of these strategies and also provides details how this can be done, for example in AWS. What are some programming strategies that I can make to cut down on my cloud bill? There are a number of strategies you can adapt: Performance Efficiency Adapt a Serverless architecture Leverage modern Web architecture (do some heavy CPU lifting like rendering) on the clients Services (don’t program) Leverage discounts From a software development point of view, making sure your software is efficient in terms of CPU usage, memory usage and I/O usage (disk, database) is most performance efficient. This efficiency will allow you to find a most ideal right sized environment. AWS Well Architected has a dedicated pillar explain how to make your code performance efficient and recommends these design principles Go global in minutes : Deploying your workload in multiple AWS Regions around the world allows you to provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost . Use serverless architectures : Serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain physical servers for traditional compute activities. For example, serverless storage services can act as static websites (removing the need for web servers) and event services can host code. This removes the operational burden of managing physical servers, and can lower transactional costs because managed services operate at cloud scale. Experiment more often : With virtual and automatable resources, you can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage, or configurations. Consider mechanical sympathy : Understand how cloud services are consumed and always use the technology approach that aligns best with your workload goals. For example, consider data access patterns when you select database or storage approaches. For more information see also Performance Efficiency – AWS Well-Architected Framework The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. Alternatively , as your usage pattern of the application is at most times quite underutilized, and spiky at exceptions you want to consider a serverless architecture for example in AWS use AWS API Gateway + Lambda, or just go straight for using the AWS Amplify framework. Also quite a cost saver, also reducing development effort is to leverage complete services that can be just deployed with a couple of clicks instead of developing and running these yourself. for example for machine learning applications see AWS Recognition. These services would only incur costs as they get used and directly offer the serverless benefits. Last option, nothing to do with actual software development and programming, is to invest in a 10 minutes read in the cost optimizing features all cloud providers offer. For example you can save up to 72%-90% of your cost if you would be able to make use AWS’s Cost Optimizing features. Typical you may also look at a mix of payment models, AWS offers Compute Saving Plans, EC2 Instance Saving Plans, Reserved I https://pubcloudnews.tech/2022/06/07/what-are-some-programming-strategies-that-i-can-make-to-cut-down-on-my-cloud-bill/"

"Cloud Computing","Cloud Computing","What are cloud security risks?","Data loss is the most common cloud security risks of cloud computing. It is also known as data leakage. Data loss is the process in which data is being deleted, corrupted, and unreadable by a user, software, or application."
"Cloud Computing","Cloud Computing","What are cloud security risks?","Specific to public cloud there are a number of factors that can increase the risk. See also What are cloud security risks? With a Public Cloud Vendor (e.g. Azure, AWS, Google Cloud Platform) infrastructure will be deployed in an environment that is accessible trough public cloud. Typical a private cloud or a on premise environment will be (total) shielded from public cloud. This significant increases the ‘attack vector’ of a public cloud solution, so can be a source of additional risk. While most security risks can be mitigated in the cloud, the most common mistake is human and organizational. Human mistakes include insufficient awareness and training and organizational mistakes are underestimation, poor management, lack of C-level support and overcommitted resources cutting security corners as they are pushed for results. Some common mistakes in cloud environments are Poor configuration of authentication and authorization, or even omitting these controls (public S3 buckets) Failure to understand cloud networking (e.g. AWS VPC and forgetting to create private endpoints) Disregard best practices, ignoring basic best practices (like not using root account in AWS) Lack of understanding of responsibility, not patching own configured operating systems, environments The consequences of these mistakes are that the risk increases that unauthorized and non authenticated users (and hackers) may find an opportunity to access data not meant for their eyes. Notice that in practice 99% of the efforts to get access are not so about the data in the cloud but rather to get in control of the resources and use these for own purposes like DDOS attacks or hosting a e-mail spam farm. https://pubcloudnews.tech/2022/06/04/what-are-cloud-security-risks/"
"Cloud Computing","Cloud Computing","What is the hypervisor in AWS?","They used to heavily use Xen - still do for things like the t2 instances, but their newer instances use a modified version of KVM called Nitro which allows them to do very interesting multiplexing with their custom hardware. I don’t work at AWS but we’ve (NanoVMs) have had to reverse-engineer their instances to provide support for the Nanos unikernel."
"Cloud Computing","Cloud Computing","What is the hypervisor in AWS?","In their simplest form, hypervisors are software, specialized firmware, or both which allow physical hardware to be shared across multiple virtual machines. The way the hypervisor does this will vary from vendor to vendor – like ESXi from WMware or Hyper-V from Microsoft, but they all accomplish the same task."
"Cloud Computing","Cloud Computing","Is cloud computing easy to learn?","If you already know how to script linux shells and setup linux services, and you have windows server administration experience, and fully understand DNS, and have network management experience, and have setup firewalls, and accumulated 3 years of experience of either python or node.js, and know how to dig, git, curl and terraform, if you feel comfortable using vim/notepad to edit json, yaml and xml, and know what are .ssh and puttygen, then the answer is Yes, cloud computing is easy to learn."
"Cloud Computing","Cloud Computing","Is cloud computing easy to learn?","That’s a bit like asking “Is rocket science easy to learn?”. Not because it is inherently difficult, but because it is a huge subject. You need to decide what it is you want to learn. And what you want to be able to do with what you have learned. You could learn about the basic concepts of cloud computing, such as correct terminology and what the broad concepts means. Or you could learn how to use one of the popular cloud platforms (but you probably need to be quite specific)."
"Cloud Computing","Cloud Computing","Is cloud computing easy to learn?","It highly depends on your current knowledge. If you have some base knowledge in cloud computing or simply IT, then it shouldn’t be difficult for you to learn cloud computing.

"Cloud Computing","Cloud Computing","What virtualization does AWS use?","Linux Amazon Machine Images use one of two types of virtualization: paravirtual (PV) or hardware virtual machine (HVM). The main differences between PV and HVM AMIs are the way in which they boot and whether they can take advantage of special hardware extensions (CPU, network, and storage) for better performance. You can read more here: Linux AMI virtualization types Linux AMI virtualization types Linux Amazon Machine Images use one of two types of virtualization: paravirtual (PV) or hardware virtual machine (HVM). The main differences between PV and HVM AMIs are the way in which they boot and whether they can take advantage of special hardware extensions (CPU, network, and storage) for better performance. For the best performance, we recommend that you use current generation instance types and HVM AMIs when you launch your instances. For more information about current generation instance types, see Amazon EC2 Instance Types . If you are using previous generation instance types and would like to upgrade, see Upgrade Paths . The following table compares HVM and PV AMIs. HVM PV Description HVM AMIs are presented with a fully virtualized set of hardware and boot by executing the master boot record of the root block device of your image. This virtualization type provides the ability to run an operating system directly on top of a virtual machine without any modification, as if it were run on the bare-metal hardware. The Amazon EC2 host system emulates some or all of the underlying hardware that is presented to the guest. PV AMIs boot with a special boot loader called PV-GRUB, which starts the boot cycle and then chain loads the kernel specified in the menu.lst file on your image. Paravirtual guests can run on host hardware that does not have explicit support for virtualization. Historically, PV guests had better performance than HVM guests in many cases, but because of enhancements in HVM virtualization and the availability of PV drivers for HVM AMIs, this is no longer true. For more information about PV-GRUB and its use in Amazon EC2, see User provided kernels . Support for hardware extensions Yes. Unlike PV guests, HVM guests can take advantage of hardware extensions that provide fast access to the underlying hardware on the host system. For more information on CPU virtualization extensions available in Amazon EC2, see Intel Virtualization Technology on the Intel website. HVM AMIs are required to take advantage of enhanced networking and GPU processing. In order to pass through instructions to specialized network and GPU devices, the OS needs to be able to have access to the native hardware platform; HVM virtualization provides this access. For more information, see Enhanced networking on Linux and Linux accelerated computing instances . No, they cannot take advantage of special hardware extensions such as https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/virtualization_types.html You can join our quora space Learn Cloud Computing"

You don't program a robot, you program the controller and it's drives to control the robot. Let's say the robot has six axis that move independently. The program tells the correct motor(s) what direction, speed, and distance to move thru the drive(s) and this is called a move. Sequences of moves are written to complete a task and that is a program. Of course there are many other divices also being controlled by the program that are or can be mounted to the robot. Hope this gives a different angle for you."

Typically, the pressure versus output force/distance/rotation curve for a pneumatic actuator is non-linear, and sometimes not even a one-to-one function. This means you need an additional sensor to close a feedback loop around the output, because running it open loop just isn't repeatable enough. Servos, in general, do what you tell 'em to do."

In any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. (i.e., the length of any side must be less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.) Therefore, if a and b are two sides, then the remaining side must be less than a+b but more than a-b, but it could be any length in between those two limits (and more information is needed to determine it)."

"Algorithms","Algorithms","Let's say you're back in time and want to learn data structures and algorithms, how will you start, and why?","Well umm … how far back in time did I go? TAOCP has been around for a very long time +-1970 IIRC for the first edition. Knuth began the project, originally conceived as a single book with twelve chapters, in … 1962 The Art of Computer Programming - Wikipedia Books about algorithms by Donald Knuth The Art of Computer Programming ( TAOCP ) is a comprehensive monograph written by the computer scientist Donald Knuth presenting programming algorithms and their analysis . Knuth began the project, originally conceived as a single book with twelve chapters, in 1962. The first three volumes of what was then expected to be a seven-volume set were published in 1968, 1969, and 1973. Work began in earnest on Volume 4 in 1973, but was suspended in 1977 for work on typesetting prompted by the second edition of Volume 2. Writing of the final copy of Volume 4A began in longhand in 2001, and the first online pre-fascicle, 2A, appeared later in 2001. [1] The first published installment of Volume 4 appeared in paperback as Fascicle 2 in 2005. The hardback Volume 4A, combining Volume 4, Fascicles 0–4, was published in 2011. Volume 4, Fascicle 6 ('Satisfiability') was released in December 2015; Volume 4, Fascicle 5 ('Mathematical Preliminaries Redux; Backtracking; Dancing Links') was released in November 2019. The published Fascicles 5 and 6 are expected to make up the first two-thirds of Volume 4B. Knuth has not announced any estimated date for release of Volume 4B, although his method used for Volume 4A is to release the hardback volume sometime after release of the paperback fascicles contained in it. Near-term publisher estimates put the release date at May or June 2019, which proved to be incorrect. [2] [3] History [ edit ] After winning a Westinghouse Talent Search scholarship, Knuth enrolled at the Case Institute of Technology (now Case Western Reserve University ), where his performance was so outstanding that the faculty voted to award him a master of science upon his completion of the bachelor degree. During his summer vacations, Knuth was hired by the Burroughs Corporation to write compilers , earning more in his summer months than full professors did for an entire year. [4] Such exploits made Knuth a topic of discussion among the mathematics department, which included Richard S. Varga . In January 1962, when he was a graduate student in the mathematics department at Caltech, Knuth was approached by Addison-Wesley to write a book about compiler design, and he proposed a larger scope. He came up with a list of 12 chapter titles the same day. In the summer of 1962 he worked on a FORTRAN compiler for UNIVAC. During this time, he also came up with a mathematical analysis of linear probing , which convinced him to present the material with a quantitative approach. After receiving his PhD in June 1963, he began working on his manuscript, of which he finished his first draft in June 1965, at 3000 hand-written pages. [5] He had assumed that about five hand-written pages would translate into one printed page, but his publisher said instead that about 1 + 1 ⁄ 2 hand-written pages translated to one printed page. This meant he had approximately 2000 printed pages of material, which closely matches the size of the first t https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming Note: Knuth is … still writing it. He has been writing it for … 50+ years."

Their analysis of the top million most highly-trafficked websites suggests that AWS accounts for approximately 3% of all Internet traffic[2] . That’s because Internet hosting is highly fragmented as a business, with many large players. The Netcraft stats are also a rough indication of just how much larger AWS can grow — it is barely scratching the surface of its addressable market.

"Cloud Computing","Cloud Computing","Why does geographical location of the data center is an important factor when choosing Cloud service providers?","Manjari provides a good explanation for speed and it is one critical factor but there are other factors such as national and international laws which mandate how users data is managed and what data must be kept “local”, how it is used, citizens rights to be forgotten, etc - consider China, Russia, India and the EUC. Disaster situations such as earth quakes, typhoons."
"Cloud Computing","Cloud Computing","Why does geographical location of the data center is an important factor when choosing Cloud service providers?","as Igor mentions, location may affect network performance. As for geographic regulation of data, it's more than just a particular locale, but also, but also who has privileged access to it. The hosting company is obviously able to provide access (such as might be requested by authorities in its home country) to the data, even when located in another country. The most important reason, though, is that for distributed applications, it's critical to ensure that you have a quorum of independent locations, so that one power or network cut doesn't take everything down."
"Cloud Computing","Cloud Computing","Why does geographical location of the data center is an important factor when choosing Cloud service providers?","Yes, it matters a lot. It is far better to host data as close as feasible to the targeted audience and users' locations. The speed is affected. The websites are loaded faster if the Data Center is near. It is always good to know the location of the Data Center of your hosting provider. It also affects SEO and security. The following points can be considered while choosing a Data Center: 1. First of all Location. 2. Reliability. 3. Security. 4. Scalability. 5. Backups."
"Cloud Computing","Cloud Computing","Why does geographical location of the data center is an important factor when choosing Cloud service providers?","Well, the latency matters. No matter how good is the quality on the internet network and the links used by any certain Cloud infrastructure, it takes time to transmit information. So, if one serve UK and London metro market for example, it makes sense to host any apps or websites there, not in the U.S. or in Asia. There are CDNs which help, but still the geo location matters for many reasons."

It might well be their current way of working would not allow the company to achieve all mentioned and promoted benefits as the operating model may not be well suited for the cloud. See also What is a good Cloud Operating Model? Lets start with what a Operating Model is: “An Operating Model should define how the Business and IT align their capabilities, processes, and workforce to reach strategic business outcomes”. The diagram depicted shows an overview of how the operating model can be organized from a Business & IT perspective: In many organizations, there is a wish to operate in this fashion, however in the real world the following model is more likley to be implemented,  expressed as “ walls ” and “ barriers ” between the classical domains of Engineering, Applications, Infrastructure and Operations as depicted in this 2 x 2 diagram: As a consequence you will find pervasive handoffs, bottlenecks, and defects are created  and defects passed downstream are often discovered late in the delivery cycle and have to be revisited. Okay, so what is a good Cloud Operating Model? In a good Cloud Operating Model you would not have these barriers . Cost is optimized by distributing accountability across pools of resources. Intuitive this is already reasonable well understood as most organizations made the shift to Agile using SAFE, Scrum and other iterative development methods as well as start to embrace the concept of DevOps. However this is still not sufficient. Why? Lets explain next. The Six Key Changes required in a cloud operating model To understand what a typical organization will need to change to successfully adapt cloud, the following areas will require a fundamental change. As explained some of these areas (iteration, devops) will intuitively already have been changed or are in flux already, however this does will not be sufficient. Lets have a look at all six key changes required: Work backwards from the customer Moving to the cloud enables your enterprise to: anticipate, respond to, and exceed your customers’ expectations in ways that were previously impossible, or too complex and expensive to consider. However to unlock this potential you have to know who they are, before you can focus on them to learn what experiences they value most. So you need to look at external parties, business, developers, operators and  sponsors as well to ensure the way your company offers cloud to its customers aligns with the value and outcomes they want it to enable. In very simple words: work backwards from the requirements of your customers who can be an external or internal party. You can ensure you deliver experiences that surprise and delight your customers by embracing a product operating model that enables consumers and suppliers to work together to provide a superior experience to each other, the enterprise, and its Customers. Re-envision the world as products Realizing the full potential of the Cloud requires reinventing the way your people work and deliver value together. In a product-based delivery model qualitative outcomes prevail over quantitative outputs. So lets focus on what a product is in a product based model.

Is it on Hyper-V or some other kind of virtualization technology?","Yes, Azure does using Hyper-V for their virtualization technology, however, it’s not the Hyper-V us consumers have access to. It’s custom specifically for Azure’s external VM usage and support. When an Azure customer uses Virtualization through Azure, they are given an RDP file to access said virtual machine, but they do not have the ability to manage the VM through the normal Hyper-V interface, it’s all hosted through Azure’s portal."

The maximum reinf. ratio is used to prevent you from overcrowding the interior of the column with reinforcement that would, in turn, restrict the flow of concrete/aggregate and reduce the availability of concrete for reinforcement to be embedded in. Too much reinforcement would also make the column impossible to construct."

In off-policy learning, the agent is free to explore, and the actions it takes do not necessarily correspond to the policy it has so far learned to be best."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What are the effects of an overlap in reinforcements?","The overlap effect is to make the reinforcement act as if it were one single bar instead of two pieces. The amount of overlap is that length of the reinforcement which has the same pullout strength as a single bar. That way the strength of the reinforcement can be counted as if there was no break at all in the bars."

"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is temperature reinforcement?","Concrete has the property of expansion and contraction due to temperature change, so reinforcement is needed to avoid the cracks generating from temperature change so these reinforcement called as temperature reinforcement or shrinkage reinforcement. They are provided generally in longer direction."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What video games use reinforcement learning?","One example was Black & White according to Demis Hassabis, which was the lead AI programmer of the game. “So actually the best AI [in 90s] was going on in games. It wasn’t this kind of learning AI we work on now, it was more finite-state machines, but they were pretty complex and they did adapt. Games like Black & White had reinforcement learning — I think it’s still the most complex example of that in a game.” Source: DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis on how AI will shape the future"
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What video games use reinforcement learning?","Almost none. I'm not aware of any mainstream games that do. Video game AI needs to be able to be understood, tuned, and controlled by designers. Reinforcement learning produces mostly black box solutions. You put in the data you want and hope it learns what you want it to. There's a world of difference between academic AI and Game AI. There not even close to the same thing."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is the difference between Markov Decision Process and Q-Learning?","In short: Q-learning is an algorithm for learning the policy that results in the optimal return when the agent operates in an environment that can be modeled as an MDP."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is the difference between Markov Decision Process and Q-Learning?","Markov Decision Process(MDP) is a model for Q-learning to be applied to. MDP defines status of an environment, action that agent can take, reward and its expectation for the action and the next status after the action. MDP just defines those factors, while Q-learning is a kind of reinforcement learning to search for the best policy to gain the most reward in a MDP model. Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning"
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is the difference between Markov Decision Process and Q-Learning?","You can solve a Markov decision process (MDP) by Q-learning. You can solve it using other techniques too such a s the Graduent methods and etc. MDP is a way to finalise the problem you are trying to solve. Q-Learning is one way to solve it."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What are the main differences between game theory and reinforcement learning?","Strategies, Action, Rewards are common in both game theory and reinforcement learning. In game theory, the environment or game space is not so big, a player has a direct contribution to change the state of a game. But in reinforcement learning the environment is so larger, a player can't usually change the environment state."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","Is it possible that reinforcements above neutral axis can exceed reinforcements below neutral axis in a doubly reinforced beam?","Sure. You could even have the entire cross section above (or below) the neutral axis if it was loaded with a large normal force and a small moment. If you mean for a pure uniaxial bending case then still yes, it's possible. I can't imagine a good reason for it in that case but still, possible."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","Is it possible that reinforcements above neutral axis can exceed reinforcements below neutral axis in a doubly reinforced beam?","I agree with the answer Lanre gave but would like to add that at supports it is almost always the case that the reinforcement above the the neutral axis will exceed the rebar below (even in doubly reinforced beams) since hogging moments generally tend to be larger than sagging moments."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","Is it possible that reinforcements above neutral axis can exceed reinforcements below neutral axis in a doubly reinforced beam?","I agree with Nav Raj’s answer. At the column support locations, the tension vs compression pattern is reversed and there you can have more reinforcing at the top than bottom (but if you consider netural axis, nothing changed as far as being less in compression because now things are upside down)"
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","Why is the objective of Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) not the same as the one for reinforcement Learning (RL)?","Because they are slightly different problems: MAB is about maximizing reward over T trials. RL is about optimizing policy (i.e. coming up with a policy that tries to maximize reward after it has been trained over T trials.) It’s sort of like the difference between a student who is trying to get good grades versus a student who is trying to get a good education."

The book Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto is the de facto standard in Reinforcement Learning. David Silver also uses that book for his course."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","Can reinforcement learning be used for anomaly detection?","Yes, of course. And it can be made very effective at this: basically, you train your RL model by giving it reward in accordance with whatever metric you define as the quality of the detected anomalies, and the system maximizes the reward by improving this metric. As time goes on, it will become better and better. You just have to be consistent in the calculation of the rewards."

Front Page ( How the Yahoo! homepage predicts your clicks )  2] Ad Format Selection on Web Pages ( Automatic ad format selection via contextual bandits ) These are just two examples, I am sure if you search bandit problem you should find even more applications along these lines."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What are some practical applications of reinforcement learning?","Deepmind reduces Google’s cooling bill by 40% (huge!!!). See: DeepMind for Google | DeepMind Since this combines automatic control and machine learning, I bet it is an application of reinforcement learning. According to the website, they are writing a paper on more details."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is reinforcement?","If a material is weak in some aspects we add other materials to make it stronger. For example, concrete is weak in tension and hence we add reinforcement in the form of steel rebates. Of course now several types of reinforcements are used which include FRP bars, TMT rebars, and even bamboo reinforcement. This word is used in other situations also. For example sending reinforcement to the army! But the context is same. Strengthening army by adding more force."

"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What are some examples for positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement?","I have not come across negative reinforcement before, looking at the explanation, it sounds like constructive criticism? I am thinking is that martial arts training is based primarily on negative reinforcement? Since we know going in that it is not a place to feed our ego, or to become complacent, it seems to work out for those that stayed the course. Keeping it short, just want to hear from feedback"
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What are some examples for positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement?","Positive reinforcement works when you praise someone when you catch them doing something good.

Function approximation reduces the memory requirements and computational complexity for training RL models when the state space is too large."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","Which videos or tutorials are the best for reinforcement learning?","I would recommend the 10 lecture series by David Silver on Reinforcement Learning. RL Course by David Silver - YouTube If you dont want to go in so much detail then you can watch the 2 videos by Prof. Pieter Abbeel on Reinforcement Learning in his AI course CS188.CS 188 Spring 2016 - YouTube"
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","Which videos or tutorials are the best for reinforcement learning?","It's not a video but rather a book, called Reinforcement Learning by Richard Sutton. It goes into a lot of detail on some commonly used algorithms and the general ethics/moral of Reinforcement Learning, and it has some practice/theory problems to test your comprehension too. Nevertheless, some understanding of Machine Learning and “some math” is needed to understand some parts of the book. I learned RL mainly with this book, so I would definitely recommend it."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","How should I decide the discount factor in reinforcement learning?","It depends. Technically or mathematically, if the number of steps is finite you can even set it 1. It only matters when the summation cannot converge without it."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","What is the difference between a neural network and an autoencoder network?","Autoencoders are a specific kind of neural networks that are trained to reconstruct their own input. That may look boring, but if you put constraints on the structure of the network or how it is train, the hidden layers may end up encoding interesting stuff."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","What is the difference between a neural network and an autoencoder network?","An autoencoder network is a type of a deep neural network whose main focus is to extract features that will help in reconstructing the original input signal back from those features efficiently. Thus, an autoencoder has a set of hidden layers for extracting such features at multiple levels successively and another set of hidden layers that follow the previous layers aimed at reconstructing the original input signal. Training such a network is with an objective that the output represents as close representation of the input as possible."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","What is the difference between a neural network and an autoencoder network?","Based on my understanding so far, its a question of is what is the difference between square and rectangle. So an autoencoder is a form of neural network and a neural network need not necessarily be an autoencoder. Autoencoder is used to “teased” out features that may be useful later on for classification problems, the teased out features will be found at the layers and nodes of the encoding part which is useful to build more accurate neural network later on. You can go to YouTube and search for more videos on Autoencoders. Most of them are useful from what I see."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Do autoencoders work better for certain deep architectures?","Autoencoders are unsupervised learning networks. In its simplest form they are used for finding efficient features from data (since human specified features may not be optimum). Essentially, they perform a dimensionality reduction on your data. You could use the features learned by autoencoders as input to algorithms like SVM or logistic regression. Or you could feed them into other deep learning architectures that perform classification or other ML tasks."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","What are the differences between InfoGAN, BiGAN, and VAE for unsupervised feature learning?","InfoGAN is for the unsupervised disentangled representation learning. BiGAN I don’t Know VAE is not based on GAN, just like autoencoder. It is a very classic generative model, but it’s samping images look very blurry, because of using the pixel-wise reconstruction loss."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","How do you transform an autoencoder into a variational autoencoder?","You add a KL divergence term to the loss function."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","How can I train an autoencoder model in Keras and then reuse the encoder layer of this model?","Here you have the answer: Ramon Viñas's answer to How do I train an autoencoder using labels?"
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Why is VAE (variational autoencoder) better for anomaly detection than AE (autoencoder) for image data?","VAEs condition their output to a probability distribution, so each of their answers automatically has a direct analytical (though not necessarily correct! that depends on the goodness of the model) likelihood attached to it. Compare that to regular AEs, where you need to figure out the likelihoods by comparing the output to all the other outputs, which may be trivial in one dimension (you just order them and see if the current output is among the lowest or the highest ones, i.e. less likely) but can get difficult for higher dimensional ones."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","What criteria should be appropriate for terminating greedy layer-wise unsupervised training of autoencoder?","Normally they use Early Stopping: keep a validation set (some data that you won't use for training, but instead for diagnosing the progress of your system) Like you track training error, also keep tracking the error on this validation set , when you find that the validation error starts increasing (even if training error is not increasing), which it does due to overfitting, stop the training. This can be done for each layer."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","How do I implement a 1D Convolutional autoencoder in Keras for numerical dataset?","What distribution does your input data have? E.g. what are the mean and std of the data? You have a ReLU as final activation, so it forces your output to be non-negative. So, if your input data are e.g. standardized (have zero mean and unit standard deviation), then the optimizer wouldn’t be capable to fit negative samples. If data are not standardized and have some negative samples, it would be the same isssue. Try to use linear activation for the final layer, or other activation which fits the distribution of your data."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Is unsupervised pre-training and greedy layer-wise pre-training methods considered obsolete for modern deep learning? Why or why not?","The answers given are good. Pre-training one way or another is EXTREMELY useful in many settings. For semi-supervised learning, it is better to jointly train with both the supervised and unsupervised objective, as Hugo Larochelle and I did in our 2008 ICML paper on discriminative RBMs. See also Ladder networks and the recent ICML work by Honglak Lee for pretty impressive results (with both pre-training and joint training, i.e., a form of curriculum learning)."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Is unsupervised pre-training and greedy layer-wise pre-training methods considered obsolete for modern deep learning? Why or why not?","It is accepted that in cases where there is an excess of data, purely supervised models are superior to those using unsupervised methods. However in cases where the data or the labeling is limited, unsupervised approaches help to properly initialize and regularize the model yielding improved performance. Pre-training is essentially obsolete, given the success of semi-supervised learning which accomplishes the same goals more elegantly by optimizing unsupervised and supervised objectives simultaneously. Semi-supervised Learning with Ladder Networks"
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Is unsupervised pre-training and greedy layer-wise pre-training methods considered obsolete for modern deep learning? Why or why not?","I wouldn’t call them obsolete, but it is currently the case that fully supervised models are superior to unsupervised ones. See my other answer on the subject Amir Rosenfeld's answer to What is the current state of deep unsupervised learning?"
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Why do the number of neurons in the hidden layer of an autoencoder need to be less than the input/output layer?","The goal of an autoencoder is to learn a good representation of the input which means that it should not be simply learning the identity function (spitting out the exact same version of the training examples basically). One way to enforce this is by making the number of hidden units less than the number of features. There are also other constraints that work very well in practice, which allow you to have more hidden units than features potentially (Sparse Autoencoder, Denoising Autoencoder, Contractive Autoencoder, etc.)."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Why do the number of neurons in the hidden layer of an autoencoder need to be less than the input/output layer?","To create an information bottleneck that forces the network to learn a compressed representation. Compression is only possible if the network can recognize correlations in the input data so, this way, we can force the network to invent a model, which is the reason we train a network in an autoencoder setting."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Why can't autoencoders do lossless compression in machine learning?","A neural network learns to approximate functions - in this case: identity function - and they are not meant for exact representations. Hence, by design, one cannot expect to get the original input."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Why can't autoencoders do lossless compression in machine learning?","Autoencoders are not meant to learn identity function because it is a trivial solution and would not be very useful. The idea is to learn an approximation to the identity function by enforcing certain constraints, such as limiting the number of hidden neurons, adding regularization, denoising, sparsity, contractive, etc. By doing so, output similar to input is generated, information may be effectively compressed and interesting structure about the data may be discovered."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Is weight sharing required for an autoencoder?","Weight sharing is not required. You can have autoencoders where both the encoder and the decoder have their own weights. As per my understanding, the only difference is this - having shared weights makes the network faster to train at the expense of less degrees of freedom. Also, if you are going to use the autoencoder for purposes other than input reconstruction (prediction of future values in case of a sequential autoencoder, for example), it would make more sense to have untied weights for the encoder and the “decoder”."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Is weight sharing required for an autoencoder?","Weight-sharing acts as a regularization on the complexity of the model since the number of parameters is halfed. This leads to faster convergence (you’re optimizing in a space of smaller dimension), but perhaps at the expense of reduced capacity."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Can an autoencoder overfit when it has much less number of hidden layer neurons than the input layer and also dropout is used?","Why not try and use denoising autoencoders? Empirically, it works much better than dropout in autoencoders."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Can we use an auto-encoder in transfer learning instead of using VGG-net (on the conv layers in the net)? Do auto-encoders learn good features to reconstruct the original image?","You can do that if ordinary encoder and decoder layers are replaced with convolutional and de-convolutional blocks. Convolutional layers can learn patterns in image data that fully connected layers of common autoencoders can't. I’ve explained this in little more detail here (refer to comments of my answer)."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Are Neural Network better than PCA in auto-encoding and reconstructing the MNIST data set?","The MNIST set is one of the easiest data sets to use. Neural networks outdo it but we are talking about the difference between 97.5% (PCA) and 99.77% (NN). Although it is an improvement, it is basically an academic one since the difference is so marginal and the accuracy for both methods is so high. Your question would be more interesting if you ask about a comparison between PCA and NN in the case of a dataset like CIFAR 100 (not CIFAR 10!). In such cases, NN beat PCA hands down though of course, they are far more complicated to train."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Are Neural Network better than PCA in auto-encoding and reconstructing the MNIST data set?","Well. The same target function, autoencoder has larger capacity. If you talk about in-sample performance, AE is better. If you talk about out-of-sample performance, hard to say."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","What is the difference between an autoassociative neural network and an autoencoder?","As far as I know, one can obtain an autoassociative memory through a bidirectional associative memory, which is implemented with no hidden layer, and whose weights are learned in one step. On the other hand, autoencoder uses (at least) one hidden layer and are trained through, e.g., SGD."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Can I substitute a PCA with an Autoencoder instead for my typical machine learning stack?","I will try to be short. PCA is linear, an autoencoder is non-linear. PCA can work with very little data, an autoencoder can overfit if you have not enough data and that's why autoencoders are really sparse autoencoders. But even a sparse autoencoder can overfit. A good rule of thumb is to try first with PCA features and see what happens, if your results are not good enough then you can try with an autoencoder, or you can even combine features from both."
"Autoencoder","Autoencoder","Is there a library that already implements deep learning algorithms like an autoencoder or convolution neural networks?","Yes. There is Keras which is an opensource library written in python. It uses Tensorflow or Theano as backend. You can find its source code here keras-team/keras . It has support for a lot of deep learning/neural network related tasks. It has support for all Deep neural networks like CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU etc. You can check this sample code in their repo keras-team/keras for more info on how to use CNN in keras.

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What are the differences between Torch and Pytorch?","Torch is primarily accessed and written in Lua, a relatively unpopular language, whereas PyTorch is accessed primarily by… python (shocker I know). Beyond that, torch is very flexible and uses an imperative graph style. However, PyTorch is even more flexible and uses something known as dynamic computation graphs, in which the computational graph is generated and executed on the fly. This is very helpful with stuff like hyper networks and synthetic gradients, which would be difficult with static computational graphs."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What are the differences between Torch and Pytorch?","PyTorch actually originated from Torch. Torch was written in Lua while PyTorch was written in Python. You can see good improvements in PyTorch over Torch and primarily comes down to how much of your requirements is filled with concepts of dynamism.

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Which companies specialise in signal processing and deep learning?","Google. “conference signal processing and deep learning” Cray, IBM and a handful of obvious choices pop up, but the conference sponsors and attendees will lists a round dozen candidate start-ups and research companies in that space. BTW other than consultants, few specialize in DSP and DL - look for companies that benefit from the technology. Areas that come to mind, other than big compute, are finance, military and medical devices."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Is using a random loss function equivalent to updating the parameters of a machine learning model randomly?","“Random” I poorly defined. We need to know more about the distribution and the model. For example, if you are looking at a neural network and just using a uniformly distributed random variable for your loss for an epoch, then you will not have a well defined gradient for update rules like gradient descent."

No contextual/semantic information embedded in one-hot vectors → not readily suitable for tasks like POS tagging, named-entity recognition, etc."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What are the main issues with using one-hot encoding?","It doesn't scale well, when the number of output labels is large. For example, in language modeling the number of output labels = vocabulary size. This means each input feature (word) will be represented as a huge vector."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Is NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti 4GB sufficient for Deep Learning?","You just don’t need any GPU . Websites such as google colab and Kaggle are giving you a pretty solid config. with Tesla K80 GPU’s and 16GB of ram. Try them they are cost effective and fast"

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Is Deep Learning memory intensive, CPU intensive or both?","Compute intensive. Compute intensive would translate to CPU intensive for most problems, not always for Deep Learning though. However, most Deep Learning compute load is not run on CPUs. That is because the type of parallel Matrix multiplications needed are not the most optimal to run on CPUs {you can run on CPUs}. One typically uses GPGPUs or other special inference hardware like NPUs or TPUs. Because the memory in these special purpose devices is limited {GPU RAM is different chips than CPU RAM and often limited}, Deep Learning might also appear as a memory intensive task."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Is Deep Learning memory intensive, CPU intensive or both?","Its GPU intensive if you have GPU or CPU intensive if you are training model on CPU (although GPU is highly recommended if dataset is large) and matrix operations take place there. It is memory intensive too, since batches of dataset will be kept in memory for processing."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Is Deep Learning memory intensive, CPU intensive or both?","Considering our own brain, I would say that the task is memory intensive, and the CPU operations are fairly simple, copy, compare, scale."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Which GPU is better for Deep Learning, GTX 1080 or Tesla K80?","The 1080 is better, hands down. If you use the K80 what you're really getting is 2x K40. The K40 is an older gpu on an older node with less memory bandwidth than the 1080's gddr5x. Plus, you will have a low bandwidth interconnect between the two and will have to deal with multi gpu parallelism. Also, the K80 is hideously expensive. The only advantage of the k80 is 12gb (24 between the two gpus). If you need that, simply get a pascal Titan x.

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What is representation learning in deep learning?","Representation learning is basically often what we mean when we say “deep learning”. It’s a paradigm of machine learning where we represent things with functions and vectors. For example, if you have a movie recommendation setup, you can model users and movies as vectors and represent the interaction between user and a movie as a function that can yield a rating. A lot of problems can be represented like this. Deep learning is representation learning where functions are hierarchical (have stacked layers)"

It uses OpenCL(similar to CUDA used by nvidia but it is open source) by default and can run well on AMD graphics cards. It also uses the same keras library used in tensorflow (a more popular DL framework). The performance of PlaidML is similar to that of tensorflow for small to medium batch sizes. As of now I dont think that ROCm would be that easy to setup as it is still in the experimental stage (also only supported on linux) and only a handful of AMD GPUs are supported."

There is this idea that you need a very fancy GPU cluster for deep learning. Yes, for extensive hyperparameter optimization, it is needed - after i get my basic algorithm working, I move to the GPU cluster in my lab. But you can start doing deep learning on a decent dataset using a simple laptop. If you can, get a machine with 1–2 NVidia cards (cheap ones used for gaming etc would do) and you can even do more intense stuff."

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why is the pooling layer used in a convolution neural network?","This is a kludge that progressively reduces - one layer at a time - the amount of data that needs to be analysed. One downside is that it equally removes bits that have high information value, along with bits that carry no information. Just one of the many inefficiencies of CNNs."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why is the pooling layer used in a convolution neural network?","Two things mainly: Reducing the size of the feature maps which helps in reducing the computational complexity Introducing shift invariance : After the pooling, location information is lost over the region it was applied. Inorder to have good performance, the network should produce consistent features even if the input is shifted"
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why is the pooling layer used in a convolution neural network?","Pooling layer is used to reduce the spatial size for representations and computations to be done. Most common ones are Max, Min and Average Pooling. Corresponding kernels are used for this purpose. Commonly used kernel size is 3x3."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why is the pooling layer used in a convolution neural network?","To reduce the resolution of the image. Dimensional space is so huge detecting features would be difficult for the neural networks."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why is the pooling layer used in a convolution neural network?","Have you ever used the phrase “More or less…” I guess that’s what the pooling layer does! You have some information and you don’t really need the exact information as you process the information, say sound frequencies in an audio patch. You don’t really care what exactly the frequency was and at what location did it play. You can have a rough idea and go ahead reducing your computational complexity by leaps and bounds! This is the reason we use a pooling layer in a convolutional neural network! Cheers!"
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why is the pooling layer used in a convolution neural network?","A short and clear answer: Basically it summarizes the output from conv. layers to reduce the amount of data you are dealing for the next layers without losing important data, similar methods used for audio data might be MFCC, audio fingerprinting (shazam)."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Can we have 3 first co-authors in a publication, or is it limited to 2?","That’s a great question for the editor of the journal you’re submitting to. Nobody else can give you a definiive answer. I think the largest number of “first” authors I’ve ever been part of was nine. But I primarily work in a field where author order isn’t a thing, so all authors are “first” authors. (Authors are always listed alphabetically.)"
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Can we have 3 first co-authors in a publication, or is it limited to 2?","I think we can have an unlimited number of people who have made equally important contributions to the paper. Unfortunately, many academics insist on finding and highlighting a single “first” author. This requirement is often nonsensical. For this reason, some papers have the footnote: “equal contributions” that is applied to two or more authors. Some labs chose to use an alphabetical order instead. Does it work? I think the alphabetical order is just outright confusing and it is often silently done. If you do so, stop immediately. The equal contribution footnote is a sensible approach, IMHO."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Can we have 3 first co-authors in a publication, or is it limited to 2?","You can have as many co-authors as you like but believe me it is best to limit the number as much as possible. Be wary of casually showing your MS to people and remember that only the first author is really entitled to determine who to show it to. You are likely to get it back with their name on it. I prefer to publish alone or with a single co-author. You should always put your student down as first author because it is your duty to promote the careers of your junior colleagues. Please understand that “et al.” consigns most co-authors to oblivion."

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How can I improve my accuracy in CNN (deep learning) for a small data set (3300 images)?","You can try knowledge transfer techniques, i.e. use a CNN pre-trained on a different task. For example if you are doing something related to computer vision try another model which is trained on Imagenet or Cifar datasets. This will both speedup your training and you might end up with a much better model. The intuition is that pre-trained NN has already learned to extract low level features from images. Therefore it only makes sense to use NN trained on similar problem, no point using a NN trained for computer vision to solve speech recognition task."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How can I improve my accuracy in CNN (deep learning) for a small data set (3300 images)?","The best ways apart from Transfer Learning ,Data Augmentation ,Ensembling would be changing the algorithm you use (better algorithm will increase the accuracy) or increase performance by tuning the hyper-parameters of your model. There is still no fancier way to do this."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How much time did it take you to use TensorFlow for your deep learning experiments the first time?","It was definitely slow going at first getting used to TF’s programming paradigm.

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How much time did it take you to use TensorFlow for your deep learning experiments the first time?","I would not know from when start counting. When I used TensorFlow for the first time I had a deep background using Python and some sort of wide understanding about neural networks and machine learning in general. I took a course at Udemy following only the examples provided there without actually programming anything from my own. So with this background it took me for about a couple hours to program my first model and some minutes to train it since it was only a toy problem."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What is pretraining in deep learning & how does it work?","Training parts of a neural network algorithms at different times is what pretraining refers to. There are three contexts where it is often used: Unsupervised embeddings are pretrained and are are used as inputs to NLP algorithms. Deep Stacked denoising autoencoder where layer wise pretraining is done one layer at a time. Embedding like methods are also used as pretrained inputs in many vision task."

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Does the order of training data matter when training neural networks?","It is extremely important to shuffle the training data, so that you do not obtain entire minibatches of highly correlated examples. As long as the data has been shuffled, everything should work OK. Different random orderings will perform slightly differently from each other but this will be a small factor that does not matter much."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Does the order of training data matter when training neural networks?","In theory, yes; different random shuffling of the training set may lead to different parameters. In practice, doesn't make that much of a difference. Since the neural network objective functions are non-convex, using different ordering of training samples would lead to possibly different local minimas. However, in practice, we observe that using different ordering of training samples doesn't result in any drastic changes in performance."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Does the order of training data matter when training neural networks?","Shuffling data while training a neural network in batches can be critical to the success of your model."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Does the order of training data matter when training neural networks?","Order of training data during training a neural network matters a great deal. If you are training with a mini batch you may see large fluctuations in accuracy (and cost function) and may end up over fitting correlated portions of your mini batch. It is very important to randomize your entire input data in order to generalize your neural network. Unless you use extremely high number of iteration (leading network to train on every sample equally), you’ll have poorly trained graph at your hand."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Does the order of training data matter when training neural networks?","In case of large models, it is sometimes hard to optimize and that order of training data from easy to hard examples makes a difference as described by the paper Curriculum Learning by Bengio et al.

"Algorithms","Algorithms","What is an easy way to find if a sequence converges or diverges?","In general you can’t. Sometimes you can try to find an upper limit by constructing a series known to converge or use convergence criteria. Integrals are a helpful tool too. Aswell as methods like Cauchy-Condensation. What you have aren’t definitions they are theorems. If a series is alternating and both the negative and positive part strictly monotonously decrease then the series converges. The other should be li m n→∞ | a n | | a n+1 | <1 l"

"Algorithms","Algorithms","How many comparisons are needed for a binary search in a set of 64 elements?","Suppose there are N elements in the set, the general understanding of encountering a search element is : (N/2^K) = 1 (LHS = number of divides needed in terms of 2 to narrow it down to 1 element = RHS) => 2^K = N Applying log (base 2) on both sides, we get: => log(2^K) = log N => K = log N For your question, N =64. K = log 64 K = log (2^6) K = 6 log 2 => K = 6 However, 6 is the average/worst case number of comparisons needed. The best case might be 1 comparison if the search element is the one in the middle at first iteration. Thank You for reading."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","How many comparisons are needed for a binary search in a set of 64 elements?","If you’re asking how many comparisons are required to binary-search 64 elements in an ordered array, then the answer is 7 in the worst case: one plus the binary log of 64. The answer would be 6 if you knew for sure that what you were looking for was in the array."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","How many comparisons are needed for a binary search in a set of 64 elements?","Is the set already sorted. Then worst case is log base 2 of the number of items + 1 => 7 +1 =8. Best is always 1 if the item to be found is in the middle. If the set isn't sorted already, then sorting it takes an extra N log N comparisons before binary search can even begin. I.e. around 64 × log2(64). At which point a linear search would have finished a long time ago."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","How many comparisons are needed for a binary search in a set of 64 elements?","T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1) This is the reccurence of BinSearch where there are n sorted objects. As you can see, it is similar to for(i=0; i<n; i*=2){} ie each call cuts down the problem to one instance worth half the size of the original problem. Hence the complexity is O(log n) where the logarithm is of base 2. Simply put, your answer is log 64 (ie 6) comparisons in worst case and 1 comparison in best case.

Consider the case where the number of edges is way smaller than the number of vertices, i.e., E=o(V) E . As always, BFS will visit every vertex for each component. Here O(V+E)≠O(E) O .

"Algorithms","Algorithms","What is the time complexity of Breadth First Search Traversal of a graph?","Imagine the graph been implemented using adjacency list. While doing BFS, it means that you have to traverse every link at-least once. Now how many links are there? thats is O(V+E). if the implementation is as adjacency matrix, you will traverse O(V^2) which may be O(E) if that is a dense graph."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","What is the time complexity of Breadth First Search Traversal of a graph?","The complexity of depth first and breadth first are the same.

This means it is O(1) typically and O(log N) in the worst case. > Also why does contains key function take O(N) in best and worst cAse. This happens if all the keys are mapped to the same bucket in the hash map and you have an implementation which is a linked list to handle collisions (as Java 1 to 7 did)"
"Algorithms","Algorithms","What is the Big-O for operations in a Hashmap?","hash map is just like an array, except each of the index gets converted by a formula and mapped to another index. since the conversion usually takes O(1) time the operations in hash maps takes the same complexity as its counterpart in an array."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","What is the Big-O for operations in a Hashmap?","Python dictionaries are an optimised version of hashmaps. The major operations are on average: Insertion : O(1) Removal : O(1) Change : O(1) Search (the in operator) : O(1) Iteration : O(n). Update (combining two dictionaries) : O(m) where m is the length of the 2nd dictionary. The worst cases for some operations are a bit different to these - for instance on occasion Insertion can degrade to a resize and insert. The hash functions are as follows : integer O(1) Float O(1) String O(n) - where n is the length of the string. Complex : O(1) Tuple - depends on the contents."

"Algorithms","Algorithms","What is the Big-O for operations in a Hashmap?","Addition, search, and deletion take constant time provided each item in an hash map generates a unique hash. If two different items generate the same hash code, then we have a collision and the complexity of the operations would depend on how collisions are resolved. There are several ways to resolve them like separate chaining, linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing, etc. If all items are different but generates the same hash code, then the performance degrades to O(n)."

In O(n log n), n is the input size (or number of elements). log n is actually logarithm to the base 2 In divide and conquer approach, we divide the problem into sub problems(divide) and solve them separately and then combine the solutions(conquer). When the list of input size n is divided into two halves, we get the log n time complexity. That’s why Merge sort’s time complexity is O(n log n). Binary search’s time complexity(which is not divide and conquer approach but divides the list into two halves) is O(log n)"

"Algorithms","Algorithms","What is the formula to find the number of sides in a polygon using an angle?","It is simple to demonstrate that the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon must be 360°. So if the given angle is an exterior angle, divide 360° by it to get the number of sides. If the given angle is an interior angle, do the same calculation above with the angle’s supplement ( θ s = 180 ∘ −θ). ("
"Algorithms","Algorithms","What is the formula to find the number of sides in a polygon using an angle?","Each side deflects from the previous direction by an angle of n. To be traveling in the same direction on a single turn, you need 360/n such deflections. The angle is the exterior, when one extends one side past the next, the deflection is what it takes to convert a straight extention to the next edge. For example, for an interior angle of 108 degrees, the deflection is 72 degrees, and 360/72 is 5, so five deflections of 72 (or an interior angle of 108 degrees), makes closure, and a pentagon to boot."

So it is: C(10,2) Combination - Wikipedia Selection of items from a set In mathematics , a combination is a selection of items from a set that has distinct members, such that the order of selection does not matter (unlike permutations ). For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange. More formally, a k - combination of a set S is a subset of k distinct elements of S . So, two combinations are identical if and only if each combination has the same members. (The arrangement of the members in each set does not matter.) If the set has n elements, the number of k -combinations, denoted as C k n {\displaystyle C_{k}^{n}} , is equal to the binomial coefficient ( n k ) = n ( n − 1 ) ⋯ ( n − k + 1 ) k ( k − 1 ) ⋯ 1 , {\displaystyle {\binom {n}{k}}={\frac {n(n-1)\dotsb (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)\dotsb 1}},} which can be written using factorials as n ! k ! ( n − k ) ! {\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}}} whenever k ≤ n {\displaystyle k\leq n} , and which is zero when k > n {\displaystyle k>n} . This formula can be derived from the fact that each k -combination of a set S of n members has k ! {\displaystyle k!} permutations so P k n = C k n × k ! {\displaystyle P_{k}^{n}=C_{k}^{n}\times k!} or C k n = P k n / k ! {\displaystyle C_{k}^{n}=P_{k}^{n}/k!} . [1] The set of all k -combinations of a set S is often denoted by ( S k ) {\displaystyle \textstyle {\binom {S}{k}}} . A combination is a combination of n things taken k at a time without repetition . To refer to combinations in which repetition is allowed, the terms k -selection, [2] k - multiset , [3] or k -combination with repetition are often used. [4] If, in the above example, it were possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there would be 3 more 2-selections: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and one with two pears. Although the set of three fruits was small enough to write a complete list of combinations, this becomes impractical as the size of the set increases. For example, a poker hand can be described as a 5-combination ( k = 5) of cards from a 52 card deck ( n = 52). The 5 cards of the hand are all distinct, and the order of cards in the hand does not matter. There are 2,598,960 such combinations, and the chance of drawing any one hand at random is 1 / 2,598,960. Number of k -combinations [ edit ] 3-element subsets of a 5-element set The number of k -combinations from a given set S of n elements is often denoted in elementary combinatorics texts by C ( n , k ) {\displaystyle C(n,k)} , or by a variation such as C k n {\displaystyle C_{k}^{n}} , n C k {\displaystyle {}_{n}C_{k}} , n C k {\displaystyle {}^{n}C_{k}} , C n , k {\displaystyle C_{n,k}} or even C n k {\displaystyle C_{n}^{k}} (the latter form is standard in French, Romanian, Russian, Chinese [5] [6] and Polish texts [ citation needed ] ).

You can implement them or not, but if you implement the one, you haven’t implemented the other. You can often implement abstract data types using several distinct data structures. For example, you can implement a dictionary using a linked list, or using a binary tree."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","How does one implement a binary tree using a linked list?","The main issue with the Singly Linked List is that we don’t have a constant time access to the elements of the Linked List because we don’t have the Information of the length of the link list , therefore operations like Binary Search cannot be implemented on link list. Although we can divide the link list in two-halves but the complexity will not be O(log n)."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","How does one implement a binary tree using a linked list?","It’s not very practical but if the data part of the node is a generic Object reference then one could chain three nodes together to make up a sort of binary tree node.

You could use list elements, with each of two links pointing down at the elements below. It would not be doubly linked, but it would be using list elements. The result would be a _tree_ not a _list_."

As such, this description is too vague, as Anindya Ray notes correctly. Everyone else is wrong, because an incomplete answer here is wrong. If you mean actually inserting the node, it’s O(1). If you mean traversing a doubly linked list to the point of insertion and then inserting, it’s O(n). That’s why you must specify the algorithm."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","What is the time complexity of inserting a node in a doubly linked list?","I will be talking about the worst-case time complexity here. The time complexity of insertion at head or tail is O(1) since you would normally have head and tail pointer in a doubly linked list. Insertion at the middle will take O(n) if you need to locate the node that you will be inserting after since you would have to perform a linear search first in order to find the node before you can perform the insertion. However, if you already have reference to a node that you will be inserting after, the time complexity of insertion will be O(1) as you would only manipulate the pointers this time."

Summary We have identified a vulnerability in the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) used to issue digital certificates for secure websites. As a proof of concept we executed a practical attack scenario and successfully created a rogue Certification Authority (CA) certificate trusted by all common web browsers. This certificate allows us to impersonate any website on the Internet, including banking and e-commerce sites secured using the HTTPS protocol. Our attack takes advantage of a weakness in the MD5 cryptographic hash function that allows the construction of different messages with the same MD5 hash. This is known as an MD5 'collision'. Previous work on MD5 collisions between 2004 and 2007 showed that the use of this hash function in digital signatures can lead to theoretical attack scenarios. Our current work proves that at least one attack scenario can be exploited in practice, thus exposing the security infrastructure of the web to realistic threats. As a result of this successfull attack, we are currently in possession of a rogue Certification Authority certificate. This certificate will be accepted as valid and trusted by all common browsers, because it appears to be signed by one of the root CAs that browsers trust by default. In turn, any website certificate signed by our rogue CA will be trusted as well. If an unsuspecting user is a victim of a man-in-the-middle attack using such a certificate, they will be assured that the connection is secure through all common security indicators: a 'https://' url in the address bar, a closed padlock and messages such as 'This certificate is OK' if they chose to inspect t https://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/ Look for SHA-512, SHA-3 or bcrypt, if you want safer hash algorithms."

The collision resistance property of SHA1 has been broken and is not usable as cryptographic hash function anymore. So if you want to use a cryptographic hash use SHA3 or at least SHA2 if SHA3 is not available.

If you really care, you can read the Wikipedia article.

Preimage attack on Keccak-512 reduced to 8 rounds, requiring 2 511.5 time and 2 508 memory. [2] Zero-sum distinguishers exist for the full 24-round Keccak-f[1600], though they cannot be used to attack the hash function itself [3] SHA-3 ( Secure Hash Algorithm 3 ) is the latest member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family of standards, released by NIST on August 5, 2015. [4] [5] [6] Although part of the same series of standards, SHA-3 is internally different from the MD5 -like structure of SHA-1 and SHA-2 . SHA-3 is a subset of the broader cryptographic primitive family Keccak ( / ˈ k ɛ tʃ æ k / or / ˈ k ɛ tʃ ɑː k / ), [7] [8] designed by Guido Bertoni , Joan Daemen , Michaël Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche , building upon RadioGatún . Keccak's authors have proposed additional uses for the function, not (yet) standardized by NIST, including a stream cipher , an authenticated encryption system, a 'tree' hashing scheme for faster hashing on certain architectures, [9] [10] and AEAD ciphers Keyak and Ketje. [11] [12] Keccak is based on a novel approach called sponge construction . [13] Sponge construction is based on a wide random function or random permutation , and allows inputting ('absorbing' in sponge terminology) any amount of data, and outputting ('squeezing') any amount of data, while acting as a pseudorandom function with regard to all previous inputs. This leads to great flexibility. NIST does not currently plan to withdraw SHA-2 or remove it from the revised Secure Hash Standard. [ needs update? ] The purpose of SHA-3 is that it can be directly substituted for SHA-2 in current applications if necessary, and to significantly improve the robustness of NIST's overall hash algorithm toolkit. [14] The creators of the Keccak algorithms and the SHA-3 functions suggest using the faster function KangarooTwelve with adjusted parameters and a new tree hashing mode without extra overhead for small message sizes. History [ edit ] The Keccak algorithm is the work of Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen (who also co-designed the Rijndael cipher with Vincent Rijmen ), Michael Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche . It is based on earlier hash function designs PANAMA and RadioGatún . PANAMA was designed by Daemen and Craig Clapp in 1998. RadioGatún, a successor of PANAMA, was designed by Daemen, Peeters, and Van Assche, and was presented at the NIST Hash Workshop in 2006. [15] The reference implementation source code was dedicated to public domain via CC0 waiver . [16] In 2006, NIST started to organize the NIST hash function competition to create a new has https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3"
"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","What is the difference between SHA-1 and SHA-3?","What is the difference between SHA-1 and SHA-3? The main difference is that SHA-1 is based on the Merkle-Damgard construction and SHA-3 is based on the sponge construction. Merkle–Damgård construction - Wikipedia Method of building collision-resistant cryptographic hash functions In cryptography , the Merkle–Damgård construction or Merkle–Damgård hash function is a method of building collision-resistant cryptographic hash functions from collision-resistant one-way compression functions . [1] : 145 This construction was used in the design of many popular hash algorithms such as MD5 , SHA-1 and SHA-2 . The Merkle–Damgård construction was described in Ralph Merkle's Ph.D. thesis in 1979. [2] Ralph Merkle and Ivan Damgård independently proved that the structure is sound: that is, if an appropriate padding scheme is used and the compression function is collision-resistant , then the hash function will also be collision-resistant. [3] [4] The Merkle–Damgård hash function first applies an MD-compliant padding function to create an input whose size is a multiple of a fixed number (e.g. 512 or 1024) — this is because compression functions cannot handle inputs of arbitrary size. The hash function then breaks the result into blocks of fixed size, and processes them one at a time with the compression function, each time combining a block of the input with the output of the previous round. [1] : 146 In order to make the construction secure, Merkle and Damgård proposed that messages be padded with a padding that encodes the length of the original message. This is called length padding or Merkle–Damgård strengthening . Merkle–Damgård hash construction In the diagram, the one-way compression function is denoted by f , and transforms two fixed length inputs to an output of the same size as one of the inputs. The algorithm starts with an initial value, the initialization vector (IV). The IV is a fixed value (algorithm or implementation specific). For each message block, the compression (or compacting) function f takes the result so far, combines it with the message block, and produces an intermediate result. The last block is padded with zeros as needed and bits representing the length of the entire message are appended. (See below for a detailed length padding example.) To harden the hash further, the last result is then sometimes fed through a finalisation function . The finalisation function can have several purposes such as compressing a bigger internal state (the last result) into a smaller output hash size or to guarantee a better mixing and avalanche effect on the bits in the hash sum. The finalisation function is often built by using the compression function. [ citation needed ] (Note that in some documents a different terminology is used: the act of length padding is called 'finalisation'. [ citation needed ] ) Security characteristics [ edit ] The popularity of this construction is due to the fact, proven by Merkle and Damgård , that if the one-way compression function f is collision resistant , then so is the hash function constructed using it. Unfortunately, this construction also has several undesirable properties: Second preimage attacks against long messages https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction Sponge function - Wikipedia Theory of cryptography The sponge construction for hash functions. P i are blocks of the input string, Z i are hashed output blocks. In cryptography , a sponge function or sponge construction is any of a class of algorithms with finite internal state that take an input bit stream of any length and produce an output bit stream of any desired length. Sponge functions have both theoretical and practical uses. They can be used to model or implement many cryptographic primitives , including cryptographic hashes , message authentication codes , mask generation functions , stream ciphers , pseudo-random number generators , and authenticated encryption . [1] Construction [ edit ] A sponge function is built from three components: [2] a state memory, S , containing b bits, a function f : { 0 , 1 } b → { 0 , 1 } b {\displaystyle f:\{0,1\}^{b}\rightarrow \{0,1\}^{b}} that transforms the state memory (often it is a pseudorandom permutation of the 2 b {\displaystyle 2^{b}} state values) a padding function P The state memory is divided into two sections: one of size r (the bitrate) and the remaining part of size c (the capacity). These sections are denoted R and C respectively. The padding function appends enough bits to the input string so that the length of the padded input is a whole multiple of the bitrate, r . The padded input can thus be broken into r -bit blocks. Operation [ edit ] The sponge function operates as follows: The state S is initialized to zero The input string is padded. This means the input is transformed into blocks of r bits using the padding function P . for each r -bit block B of the padded input: R is replaced with R XOR B (using bitwise XOR ) S is replaced by f ( S ) This process 'absorbs' (in the sponge metaphor) all blocks of the padded input string. The sponge function output is now ready to be produced ('squeezed out') as follows: the R portion of the state memory is output repeat until enough bits are output: S is replaced by f ( S ) the R portion of the state memory is output If less than r bits remain to be output, then R will be truncated (only part of R will be output). Another metaphor describes the state memory as an ' entropy pool ', with input 'poured into' the pool, and the transformation function referred to as 'stirring the entropy pool'. [3] Note that input bits are never XORed into the C portion of the state memory, nor are any bits of C ever output directly. The extent to which C is altered by the input depends entirely on the transformation function f. In hash applications, resistance to collision or preimage attacks depends on C , and its size (the 'capacity' c ) is typically twice the desired resistance level. Duplex construction [ edit ] It is also possible to absorb and squeeze in an alternating fashion. [4] This operation is called the duplex construction or duplexing. It can be the basis of a single pass authenticated encryption system. The state S is initialized to zero R is XORed with the first r -bit block https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge_function The sponge approach has a number of advantages, such as resistance to length extension attacks and adjustable hash size. The book Serious Cryptography by Jean-Philippe Aumasson has excellent material on this topic."

"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","Are there any practical commutative hash functions?","If n>1 and m>1 and p is prime and p>m and p>n, then your hash function can be just multiplication by n or m mod p. Since multiplication is commutative your hash functions are too. One issue with this approach is that your hash result is usually just about as long as your original message so you need to add some sort of truncation, compression, or reduction operation for most use-cases. One way to do this is to pad the result with zeros on the left if necessary and take the rightmost ten digits or so."

There are different versions of SHA, but as it has become obvious that SHA-128 is not strong enough it is now mostly either SHA-256 or SHA-512 and with different salting schemes."
"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","Which algorithms are most used in password hashing?","Hashing ican be done by quite a few ones. We like SHA 256 or higher. SHA1 is not recommended as it can be reversed."
"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","In Cryptographic hash functions, why are alphanumeric strings of output 64-digits long?","The hash is not an alphanumeric string, it is a string of bits, often 256 (but not always). They are often represented as 32 bytes (each of 8 bits), and these in turn are represented as 2 hexadecima digits (0 to 9 and A to F). So these appear to be 64 characters in 0123456789ABCDEF."

"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","Can an MD5 hash be decrypted knowing the length and some characters of the input?","It cannot be decrypted exactly, but it kind of can! As you indicate, an md5 hash could be the same for lots of different inputs. But if you know the input is a word for example then it is unlikely to match for 2 words. Decrypted keep dictionaries of words and their md5 hashes to work backwoods to cracking poorly designed systems/databases. If the string is short enough the calculation could be brute force hacked. This is why passwords should be never words or common strings and why good systems should use things like strong nonces (number used once)."
"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","Can an MD5 hash be decrypted knowing the length and some characters of the input?","The MD5 cryptographic algorithm is not reversible i.e. We cannot decrypt a hash value created by the MD5 to get the input back to its original value. So there is no way to decrypt an MD5 password. No! A hash may not be reversed, which means it cannot be decrypted. By design a hash algorithm has no inverse, there is no way to get the original message from the hash. ... When using a publicly known hash function for storing password hashes, make sure to always use a salt or shared secret."
"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","Why do hash functions such as SHA-256 or MD5 have a fixed digest length?","How are you going to compare 2 hashes if they are different lengths? If somebody publishes a SHA256 hash with 258 bits, how are you going to calculate those extra 2 bits? They could have just picked a couple of random bits. There’s no security unless everybody uses the same algorithm that gives the same number of bits."
"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","Why do hash functions such as SHA-256 or MD5 have a fixed digest length?","Assume the case that hash functions produce the digest of variable lengths. In that case the strength of hashing function is same as much as the length of the least variable length message digest it produces. Assume some XYZ hash algorithm produces digests of length 10,20,30 bytes and so on…, considering this, the strength of this XYZ hashing technique relies in mapping all of input into the space of 2^80(for 10 bytes). So what’s the point in having variable length digests if they aren’t making the hash function any stronger and further which does going to make implementation of them harder?"
"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","What are the applications of hash tables?","If you write code in Python, then almost everything is hash tables: dictionaries and sets are hash tables making search, insertion and deletion very quick. Python keeps a list of the modules that are imported - that is a dictionary - hence a hash table. Within each module - the module level attributes, classes and functions are maintained as dictionaries - hence a hash table Within each class the the set of attributes and methods within that class are maintained as dictionaries - i.e. a hash table"

"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","What problem are solved when using a hash table?","If you have a bunch of keys and values and want to find a value by a given key, having them stored in an unsorted array would be O(n) O , sorted array would be O(logn) O , while hash table is O(1) O . Since having keys and values like that is extremely common, and the performance of hash tables is extremely good, the end result is that in the real world a hash table is the answer to almost every question, LOL :D"
"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","What problem are solved when using a hash table?","hash table are goods to convert strings to integers that can easily be used by a computer. the problem it has only is that the implementation can often result in code that is slower than actually comparing a string or, in code that repeats the hash. which is even worst and cause bugs."

"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","How do I get hashed passwords from my database?","Storing a password as a plain text field is a terrible idea, but storing it encrypted using a two-way algorithm is also terrible. Why? Because if we encrypt and store the password using an encryption key and an algorithm that allows us to encrypt the password and decrypt it from that key, anybody with the encryption key can decrypt it. In most cases, storing the representation of a password in the database is the proper thing to do."

I am willing to bet that you misheard what he said; I bet what he meant was that binary search is best for non-hash algorithms. Note: 1. If you pick a hash function with collisions, your rate will be O(1+α) O , where α α has been shown by Bob Jenkins to be a limit of .66. So, it is still basically O(1)"
"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","Search Algorithms: Why can't there be an algorithm faster than binary search?","It cannot be done with fewer pairwise comparisons. The reason is that at best, every comparison halves the number of possible locations where the key can be. This is exactly what happens in binary search. Given n possible locations, you need to halve log(n) times. So that's optimal. You get the same performance with a balanced BST. If you use a technique that doesn't use pairwise comparisons, like hashing, the story changes."

"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","Search Algorithms: Why can't there be an algorithm faster than binary search?","It depends on how the list is stored and if an additional index can be created. The method I developed in the 80's for a list of words is similar to prefix sort in that it creates 676 partitions with indexes to each. The first search narrows the list to the associated partition. From there binary search can be used on a much smaller list. When I modified to use 676 sorted trees the search became even faster."

To quote the relevant section: If the map previously contained a mapping for the key, the old value is replaced."
"Hash Functions","Hash Functions","Is it possible to update a value of a key in HashMap in Java?","The map holds unique keys. When you invoke put with a key that exists in the map, the object under that key is replaced with the new object. Simply write: count.put('a', 2); The value will override."

"Data Science","Data Science","How many independent variables can you have in multiple regression?","This is not a formal guideline, but I’ve always worked with the suggestion that the number of independent variables should be at most one-fifth of the sample size. For example, in a data set with n = 100 points, you should limit the number of independent variables to 20."
"Data Science","Data Science","How many independent variables can you have in multiple regression?","One. If you have more than one dependent variable then you want either separate multiple regressions or a multivariate regression."
"Data Science","Data Science","How many independent variables can you have in multiple regression?","There is only one dependent variable in a multiple regression. Take the example of the following multiple regression equation: y= α 0 + α 1 x 1 + α 2 x 2 + α 3 x 3 +… y Here y y is the dependent variable and x 1 x , x 2 x , x 1 x , … … are independent variables."
"Data Science","Data Science","How many independent variables can you have in multiple regression?","You need at least one degree of freedom. The number of degrees of freedom of a regression model is n-p when n is the sample size and p is the number of parameters (including the intercept). So if you have 10 observations, you an theoretically have as much as 8 independent variables (assuming all of them are numerical variables. if you have a categorical variable the calculation of p is little more complicated)"
"Data Science","Data Science","What is the difference between a multiple linear regression and a multivariate regression?","Suppose you want to perform regression on - independent variable X 1 ,⋯, X m X  for - dependent variable Y 1 ,⋯, Y n Y When m > 1, it is usually called 'multiple regression' or 'multi-variable regression' When n > 1, it is usually called 'multi-variate regression' Of course you can have 'multiple/multi-variable multi-variate regression,' i.e., m > 1, n > 1. Yes, it is confusing, especially when people misuse them."
"Data Science","Data Science","What is the difference between a multiple linear regression and a multivariate regression?","Properly speaking, multivariate regression deals with the case where there are more than one dependent variables while multiple regression deals with the case where there is one DV but more than one IV. However, many authors use 'multivariate' where they should use 'multiple' (this is mostly authors in fields other that statistics)"
"Data Science","Data Science","What is the difference between a multiple linear regression and a multivariate regression?","The difference between multivariate and multiple, as they relate to regression.

"Data Science","Data Science","Does logistic regression require independent variables to be normal distributed?.","No, logistic regression does not require any particular distribution for the independent variables. They can be normal, skewed, categorical or whatever. No regression method makes assumptions about the shape of the distribution of either the IVs or the DV. OLS regression assumes that the errors are normally distributed."
"Data Science","Data Science","Does logistic regression require independent variables to be normal distributed?.","In my experience it is not required for a logistic regression. But then I am an old timer and many things have been modified or redeveloped in Statistics since then. Perhaps I have missed it, but to fit the model that assumption of normality for the independent variable is not a requirement. The errors are assumed to be independently normally distributed. It will be interesting to see an example to the contrary."
"Data Science","Data Science","Does logistic regression require independent variables to be normal distributed?.","I am not sure what that article is referring to. Logistic regression does not require the predictors to be multivariate normal. Maybe this meant something else but I'm not sure what though. If 'outliers' means correctly-classified points very distant from the hyperplane, then yes they don't matter in the sense that moving them anywhere not inside the margin doesn't change the loss. 'Outliers' meaning misclassified points are a different matter, since SVMs needed some special formulation to consider them, and do matter to SVMs."
"Data Science","Data Science","Does logistic regression require independent variables to be normal distributed?.","First, logistic regression does not require a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Second, the error terms (residuals) do not need to be normally distributed. Third, logistic regression requires there to be little or no multicollinearity among the independent variables."
"Data Science","Data Science","Does logistic regression require independent variables to be normal distributed?.","No, I don't know what that paper is talking about."
"Data Science","Data Science","Does logistic regression require independent variables to be normal distributed?.","No, logistic regression does not have any such prerequisites on the distribution of data points.

"Data Science","Data Science","If data is skewed, does that mean the standard deviation is inaccurate?","“Inaccurate” is the wrong word. The accuracy of the standard deviation (SD) depends only on the accuracy of the numbers. But, for skewed data, the SD may not be very useful. We often use the median (rather than the arithmetic mean) as a measure of central tendency for skewed data (e.g. income). It’s not that the mean is inaccurate, it’s that it isn’t usually what we want. And if teh mean isn’t what you want, then the SD also isn’t what you want (because the SD is based on the mean). Hence, people use interquartile range or full range or median absolute deviation (MAD) for skewed data."
"Data Science","Data Science","If data is skewed, does that mean the standard deviation is inaccurate?","No, Skewness of data indicates that more data points in the dataset are concentrated to one side of the central tendency value of the dataset. Standard deviation is not the measure of skewness, but dispersion, however you can get an idea about skewness using value of standard deviation. Skewness = 3 * (Mean - Median) / Standard Deviation"
"Data Science","Data Science","If data is skewed, does that mean the standard deviation is inaccurate?","Not at all, it means the SD will hav a skew as well. Skew doesn't mean anything negative, certainly not inaccurate or wrong. It means it is non-standard, either because that is the nature of the subject or the nature of the subject data at that sample size, or it is just a small sample."
"Data Science","Data Science","If data is skewed, does that mean the standard deviation is inaccurate?","The other answer says no, but in a loose sense you are correct. The SD is an average of the width of the distributions on both sides of avererage of the distribution. For skewed distributions the two sides will not contribute equally. The concept of semi-variance covers this. Look it up and good luck."
"Data Science","Data Science","If data is skewed, does that mean the standard deviation is inaccurate?","No. It merely means that a purely Gaussian probability distribution is inappropriate to describe this sort of phenomenon."
"Data Science","Data Science","If data is skewed, does that mean the standard deviation is inaccurate?","For a skewed distribution it is better to use the median as a measure of central tendency, instead of the mean, and the (first and third) quantiles as indicators of spread and skweness. It may be useful to take the logs of the data as they might approximate a lognormal distribution."

"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is difference between off-policy and on-policy in reinforcement learning?","First off, a policy, π(a|s) π , is a probabilistic mapping between action, a a , and state, s s . Not all policies are optimal so we need methods to improve a policy, methods that fall into either on-policy or off-policy. On policy methods attempt to evaluate or improve the same policy that is used to make decisions, whereas off policy methods evaluate or improve a policy different from one that was used to generate the data. Therefore, Off means off the original (or previous) policy."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is difference between off-policy and on-policy in reinforcement learning?","off policy uses all the policies from its previous iteration stored by action-replay method to predict the current policy. on-policy is more like a Markov approach with new policy prediction based only on the current policy. In fact the off-policy helps stabilize the RL training, but can not consider latest updates to policy into account. which is well by on-policy. We need to find a fine valence between off-policy and on-policy in RL methods."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","How do modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms deal with high dimensional state space and action space?","I cannot speak for everyone, but the way I have worked with this problem is to utilise neural networks to then infer a Q matrix as node weights. This method itself have a number of issues though, namely the networks get upset during training, methods such as experience replay help."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","How do you handle illegal action in reinforcement learning?","There are 2 ways to handle illegal actions. One is to have a hard constraint where you just remove the action from the agent’s action space altogether. This will ensure that all actions chosen by the agent is a valid action. The other way is the ignore/clip the action so that if an illegal action is taken, it will be ignored and the substituted with a random action or closest action. A third option is to add a soft constraint so that each time an illegal action is taken, the agent receives a very high penalty so that it learns not to take that action."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","How do you handle illegal action in reinforcement learning?","Say you are in a cell in the top row in a grid world. If you perform an “up” action, you should ideally remain in the same state unless you are at the goal. This shouldn’t lead to complications. In essence, you ignore the invalid move."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","Do data scientists use reinforcement learning?","In a few domains, yes where systems need to learn online and the table of states and actions is small enough that it can be readily tabulated. The classic examples are elevator scheduling and piloting vehicles. However, in my opinion, the possible realm of application for reinforcement learning is limited. This is due to the size of the system that can be tackled. Take a look on Google Scholar, there are very few new papers out there using RL."

"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What's the difference between deterministic policy gradient and stochastic policy gradient?","Deterministic policy means that for every state you have a clear defined action you will take. Stochastic policy means that for every state, for you to take an action, you draw a sample from possible actions that follow a distribution. When you refer to deterministic policy gradient and stochastic policy gradient, you probably refer to the above analogy applied in policy gradient algorithms as to whether your aim is towards solving for a deterministic policy setting or a stochastic policy setting."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What's the difference between deterministic policy gradient and stochastic policy gradient?","The deterministic policy is one in which at every state we have a determined action to take. Think of it like we have pairs of State and a specific action for that state. Gradient corresponding to such policy is a deterministic policy gradient. On the other hand in Stochastic policy, we have a distribution of actions to take at each state. So gradient for this kind of policy is a stochastic gradient."

"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is the difference between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning?","It is same that both learnings are to gain the most reward from agent’s actions. The model-based reinforcement learning tries to infer environment to gain the reward while model-free reinforcement learning does not use environment to learn the action that result in the best reward. The model-based learning uses environment, action and reward to get the most reward from the action. The model-free learning only uses its action and reward to infer the best action."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is the difference between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning?","Model-based RL constructs a model of the world, whereas model-free RL tries to directly learn the best policy."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is the difference between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning?","Model based learning attempts to model the environment, and then based on that model, choose the most appropriate policy.

Udacity has a fun lecture series I recommend on reinforcement learning that talks about these concepts: Machine Learning Course On Reinforcement Learning"
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","Why do we use the Ornstein Uhlenbeck Process in the exploration of DDPG?","It depends on the environment, we don’t necessarily need to use an OU process to explore, in the case of continuous control it is better to have temporally correlated exploration that suit the dynamics (example torques for joints) to get smoother transitions. If you look at a graph of an OU process, you will see that it is relatively ‘smooth’ in time, on the other hand, pure Gaussian noise is not temporally correlated and is therefore less suitable for control tasks."

"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is the difference between supervised learning and reinforcement learning?","I think they are scarcely comparable. Supervised learning acts for the most part on static datasets. Reinforcement learning acts on data continuously as it becomes available. SL has no hope of learning to control a robot for example, as the task barely even makes sense in a SL framework."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is the minimum reinforcement in raft foundation?","Raft Footings are normally used to distribute gravity loads when soil conditions do not support point loads. The main problem is differential settlement. When one element of the building support settles more than another (relatively speaking) The alternatives to traditional footings is piles (friction or end bearing). Depending on soil conditions, minimal shrinkage reinforcement may be all that is necessary. Should contact a geotechnical engineer, or look at local practice for input."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is the minimum reinforcement in raft foundation?","It depends on earth quake zones, structure of soil, and the building itself but in worst condition it must be around 150 kg reinforcement bar per each m3 of concrete and in best conditions it must be around 110 kg reinforcement bar per each m3 of concrete. However local norms are determinant for this kind of question, this information that I gave is just an assumption for world wide average."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is the minimum reinforcement in raft foundation?","Reinforcement of Foundation are basically derived from the earthquake zones specified in Code and nature of soil . But in general term… around 0.12 to 0.15 tonne of Reinforcement for a m3 of concrete would be sufficient"
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","Is it possible to use reinforcement learning to solve any supervised or unsupervised problem?","Yes, but reinforcement learning provides lower dimensional information, so there's no real benefit to doing so. For example, if you want to use it for classification, you get significantly less information per example using reinforcement learning as opposed to using supervised learning. So you can, but you’re crippling yourself by using RL instead of supervised learning."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","How can I understand the math notation in deep learning research papers?","Here’s the notation page for the Deep Learning book: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/notation.html Different authors use different notation though."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","Why is reinforcement learning not considered unsupervised learning?","Supervised learning has you give it a set of examples and answers to learn from Unsupervised learning has you give it examples, and it learns something based on it. Reinforcement learning has the system take in data, produce some results, then receive feedback on those specific results, and repeat. It'd not supervised learning because you don't need to provide all the answers ahead of time, and it can work in cases where that concept don't even make sense. And it's not Unsupervised because it needs feedback"
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is the observation space of an environment in OpenAI Gym?","It depends on each problem. Some problems have images as observation. Some use some numbers to present observation such as velocity or position…"
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is the observation space of an environment in OpenAI Gym?","An observation space is a set of values reflective of the environment state that the agent has access to. These values, also known as features, can be very low level like the raw pixels of a robots video feed or describe higher level constructions like the angle of the robot’s joints."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","How many TPUs are required to train AlphaGo Zero?","AlphaGo Zero uses zero (haha) TPUs to train. What?????? Yeah, zero. While the first generation TPU that Google released was unsuitable for training, the second generation is. Curiously, however, Google apparently still opted for GPU training. In the AlphaGo Zero paper, “Each neural network is optimized on Google Cloud using TensorFlow, with 64 GPU workers and 19 CPU parameter servers.”"
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","How do I weight reward vector in reinforcement learning?","Typically in reinforcement learning you wouldn’t base the reward off of intermediate values in your game. Just give the algorithm a positive reward if it does what you want and a negative reward (or zero reward) if it doesn’t. It is up to the RL algorithm to figure out how to use observations available to it to maximize the reward signal."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","How do I weight reward vector in reinforcement learning?","Rather than using money, power and hp as rewards, use them as state features. then for win do 1 or 1,000,000 reward. Losing resulting in a negative counterpart. it will then (hopefully) learn by itself what to do for any combi of money, power and hp."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is a finite horizon in the context of reinforcement learning?","Finite horizon is the agent’s time to live. Intuitively, you can think of what would happen if you are told you only have 30 days to live, a finite horizon. Your goals and objectives would be completely flipped. Well, the same happens in RL, if the number of steps the agent has left are changed, then the agent will behave differently depending of how many steps it has left."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What is the difference between reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learning?","Reinforcement learning is where an agent attempts to maximize its rewards in an environment. By contrast, in inverse reinforcement learning, an agent attempts to follow a “teacher agent” through rewards and does so under the assumption that the teacher agent is maximizing its rewards. In practice, the “teacher agent” can often be another algorithmic action we want the agent to follow (such as RL agents trying to learn SGD)"
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","For a circular beam, should the reinforcement of the beam lie outside or inside of the slab reinforcement?","The top reinforcement would in the slab itself because slab and beams are cast monolithic."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What distinguishes reinforcement learning from deep learning?","Deep learning is an approach to implementing function approximation. Reinforcement Learning is a learning problem in which the goal is to learn from interaction how to act in an environment to maximize a reward signal. There are many different algorithms to solve RL, many which involve function approximation, which when coupled with the above is what leads to deep reinforcement learning."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What distinguishes reinforcement learning from deep learning?","Deep Learning is automating the extraction of high-level features from data (say computer learns to recognize human eye/ear is an essential feature of the face after seeing many photographs). Reinforcement Learning is modifying/learning new trends from each incoming data point dynamically. They are not mutually exclusive things. One might be able to use Deep Learning for Reinforcement Learning."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","What distinguishes reinforcement learning from deep learning?","reinforcement learning is more about perceiving the world and controlling. Deep learning is a general framework used for image recognition, data processing. Deep learning is also used in reinforcement learning for approximating the value functions or the policy functions."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","Does SpaceX use any deep learning (or machine learning) to land rockets?","Probably. Neural networks are better at adapting to odd behavior than humans writing C — i.e. if a thruster isn’t operating properly an adaptive (AI) system can often cope. You can train such systems in simulation rather than on real hardware too."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","How is reinforcement learning related to genetic algorithms?","Reinforcement learning(RL) and genetic algorithms (GA) solve the same class of problems: Searching for solutions that maximise or minimise a function. Reward or cost function. Other that the fact they solve the same class of problems, they are different, in their aims and methodologies. GA work ends with finding an optimal solution. RL in a live long learning mechanism where the agent can already explore the current state and learn as he goes. Now in some problems one can be creative and combine both approches, The agent for example can start for states that are already optimised by GM."
"Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning","How is reinforcement learning related to genetic algorithms?","Reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms operate on the same basic premise: They both try something, receive a “how good it is” (reward for rl and fitness for ga), then try and do something to get a higher “how good it is” signal. The key difference lies in how they “try to get a higher signal”. RL algorithms use mathematically defined frameworks such as SARSA, Q-learning, TD, etc. By contrast, genetic algorithms randomly mutate a “population”, select the top few “specimens” and repeat."

How are they related?","Encoder-decoder is a rather general term that can be applied to a lot of software and hardware objects that were around for a long time. A CNN is a very different computer program. Even though it can be viewed as an encoder-decoder, that view is not going to help anyone! One must first master NN’s and then go onto CNN’s. They are stand-alone topics. Mastering anything else, even certain topics in machine learning will not help at all with CNN’s."

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What does end to end mean in deep learning methods?","End to end is a vague term, used by researchers often as per their convenience. Let say, if your input is denoted by X and the output that you would like to obtain is Y. If your deep learning model takes X as input and in the final layer produces Y, it is called end-to-end. However, instead if your deep model produces Z and then Z is processed outside the deep model to produce Y, it is called “not end-to-end”. However, this definition is often twisted as per convenience."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What does end to end mean in deep learning methods?","Hi Please find the answer to this question given by Anderw Ng at this video:"
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What does end to end mean in deep learning methods?","If I understand the question correctly, for “non-deep” learning, the system will include many more things than just neural networks - this is exactly what deep learning tries to avoid, the need for extensive feature engineering (preprocessing stages where you try to massage the data in a form that gives good results when fed to the ANN) and post-processing (selecting the likely correct result from the ones proposed by the network). For example for recognizing text, you’d have spell checkers, syntax checkers and what not, besides the network that is doing the text recognition itself."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What is the difference between OpenCV and deep learning, and how do I learn computer vision from scratch?","OpenCV is a library of already written code. Deep learning is a technique that uses artificial neurons to categorize objects. OpenCV is like a calculator with a collection of common functions and deep learning is a specific function like long division. If you want to learn about them, then the fastest way to learn is by doing a project. So go write a program that recognizes squares in a video! Some tips: First, learn to program Download openCV and look through the documentation Look for OpenCV tutorials online."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What is the difference between OpenCV and deep learning, and how do I learn computer vision from scratch?","OpenCV is an open source software library/toolbox with APIs in many programming languages. It contains a collection of tools and implementations of papers that are state-of-the-art in image processing and computer vision. Deep Learning is the fancy term that refers to the modern re-incarnation of neural networks. For resources to learning computer vision, let me point you to a good answer by Dan here."

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How many layers are required to be called deep neural network?","You need an input layer. You need an output layer. If you only have one layer in the middle, that’s not Deep Learning. Anything more than that creates a deep neural network."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How many layers are required to be called deep neural network?","There are 3 layers in a deep neural network. The input layer 2. The hidden layer (that's where the neurons are) 3. Output layer"
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What is the difference between FP16 and FP32 when doing deep learning?","Half-precision floating point format (FP16) uses 16 bits, compared to 32 bits for single precision (FP32). Lowering the required memory enables training of larger models or training with larger mini-batches"
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What is the difference between a neural network and a social network?","While the social network is made up of individuals, the neural network is made up of neurons. Humans communicate either with long-range telecommunications instruments or with their biologically-defined communication apparatus, whereas neurons develop dendrites and axons to receive and emit signals."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What is the difference between a neural network and a social network?","Both are networks but one is of people (social) and other of neurons (code that imitates actual neurons). froot.co.in"
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","To what resolution should I resize my images to use as training dataset for deep learning?","It depends upon the primary memory available to you and the size of the training dataset you are using. For cifar10, the image size is 32*32. In my case, I have a laptop with 8GB RAM and using the flower database of google, which are having about 3400 images of 5 categories of flowers. I tried to resize the image in 200*200. It was giving out of memory error. Then I changed the resolution to 100*100 and it was running fine."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","To what resolution should I resize my images to use as training dataset for deep learning?","Although its no requirement, the most important thing is that your images are all the same resolution. The output size reduces automatically with several convolutional layers."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","To what resolution should I resize my images to use as training dataset for deep learning?","I'd tell you that you have to worry about overfitting with too high a resolution but I'm not sure there's enough knowledge out there to be able to find a good answer. Are you using a neural net? What algorithms are you trying? Are you building your own setup or using something from somewhere. Check the research."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What is a teacher student model in a Convolutional neural network?","I believe you are referring to work that involves model distillation. It turns out that once a Deep CNN is learnt, you can ‘compress’ the same in another much smaller network, and the smaller network does a reasonable job of approximating the original function learnt by a deep CNN. However, there is a catch, the compressed model (student), is trained to mimic the output of the larger network (teacher), instead of training it on the raw data directly. This has something to do with how the deeper network learns hierarchical abstractions of the features."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What is a teacher student model in a Convolutional neural network?","Simply put: The teacher network is first trained on the task. It will output floats (probabilities) instead of boolean (0–1 integer) labels. The student will then learn from the teacher and because the teacher informs the student of the nuances and shades of gray, then the student can learn things in a better way. Some other training setups train the teacher at the same time the student is trained. Also, sometimes a hidden layer of the teacher can be used instead of the output layer."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why is a convolution neural network harder to train on color images compared to grayscale images?","Its not harder, it depends on your dataset. You are starting with 3 feature maps instead of 1. So: If you don’t have more data, you are more prone to overfitting than grayscale. It is more compute and memory intensive. However, you are starting out with more features which with more data will probably produce better results overall on most datasets… So again, it depends on your application and dataset."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why is a convolution neural network harder to train on color images compared to grayscale images?","I'm not sure I would call this a rule but if I must, I'd say it's because there are 3 times more input neurons (which is really negligible considering the entirety of neurons). The contrary may be true simply because color provides lots of queues. Think about differentiating between an orange and a lemon without colors vs. with."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How do I increase accuracy using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs / ConvNets) for regression?","There are a few ways to improve this current scenario, Epochs and Dropout. An alternative way to increase the accuracy is to augment your data set using traditional CV methodologies such as flipping, rotation, blur, crop, color conversions, etc. One other way to increase your training accuracy is to increase the per GPU batch size. However, if you're still plagued by poor performance then your data set might just be lacking enough data."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why don’t convolutional neural networks use grayscale images as input to improve performance?","Depending on your use-case you might lose valuable information (information that might be required for the task). Another reason is Feature learning : In general it is prefered if you just can put the raw data into the network and it does then the preprocessing. Then the network itself decides what representation of the data is required. But of course: For some use-cases it can be very reasonable (e.g. I created a network for newspaper article segmentation; there I only used greyscale inputs, because the colors didn’t matter there)."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why don’t convolutional neural networks use grayscale images as input to improve performance?","In some senses they kind of do… they often decompose the image into RGB values, essentially 3 greyscale images then train the model on these three “greyscale” inputs."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why don’t convolutional neural networks use grayscale images as input to improve performance?","A lot of the time people do train on greyscale images and convert images that it is meant to predict to greyscale. Because sometimes color information isn’t necessary to the task. But some tasks could need color your results could be improved with color data. It really depends on your task."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Are there any image datasets like CIFAR-10 where images are of uniform sizes like 32 X 32 in CIFAR-10?","Imagenet, COCO, PASCAL VOC, MNIST, most of the well known ones are really."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What is layer freezing in transfer learning?","Layer freezing is process of freezing the weights of specific layer in deep learning network so that these wights don’t change during training. Typically in transfer learning we freeze most of the layers excpet top few layers and then fine tine top layers on new image dataset. Read this blog for more details."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What is layer freezing in transfer learning?","Freezing a layer prevents its weights from being modified. This technique is often used in transfer learning, where the base model is frozen. Thank You"
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why are the often dense layers at the end of convolutional neural networks?","The first group of layers in a CNN do feature extraction, using convolutional filters, rectilinear activation, and subsampling. The dense layers at the end form a neural network that classifies these features and in doing classify the images. Did you study neural networks before moving onto CNN’s?"
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How can we pass numeric data as an input to a convolutional neural network using Python TensorFlow?","Anything that you pass to a neural network (of any kind, AFAIK) is numeric data, since a network is a mathematical function with its domain defined to be numbers."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why do finance firms like Goldman Sachs, Quadeye hire machine learning profile engineers or how is ML being applied in finance?","ML helps solve problems for which the underlying theory is either not well developed, or too complex to be calculated in real time. As you can guess, Goldman has a lot of such problems, as does every other company. The difference between becoming successful and lagging behind is to let the data guide your decisions rather than emotions. A good data scientist can help in former. Hence we hire Data Scientists who can think practically as well as are well versed with basic Data Science techniques. Needless to say it’s a rare skill."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why do finance firms like Goldman Sachs, Quadeye hire machine learning profile engineers or how is ML being applied in finance?","Hi, As you know the main task of ML is to automate things and reduced himan effort. Goldman Sachs are handling billion dollars of fund hence they can't rely on human to manage this much huge fund. By using ML they can design financial model which can help them to handle huge fund with minimal error."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How does LSTM help prevent the vanishing (and exploding) gradient problem in a recurrent neural network?","Because LSTM architecture allows disabling of writing to a cell by turning 'off' the gate, thus preventing any changes to the contents of the cell over many cycles. This means that longer term dependencies can be learned; which aren't possible with tanh-type architectures. Similarly even when the gate is 'open', LSTM update equation does not completely replace the contents of a cell at any time, rather maintaining a weighted average of a new value and previous value."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How does LSTM help prevent the vanishing (and exploding) gradient problem in a recurrent neural network?","I’d like to point out that this is a common misunderstanding. LSTMs only solves gradient vanishing problem: they also suffer from gradient explosion problem. See Why can RNNs with LSTM units also suffer from 'exploding gradients'? for details."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How does LSTM help prevent the vanishing (and exploding) gradient problem in a recurrent neural network?","So I will begin by noting that a comprehensive answer can be found at a similar Quora post: How does LSTM help prevent the vanishing (and exploding) gradient problem in a recurrent neural network? However, fundamentally this can be answered by noting that the gradient stability can be attributed to the carouseling of error as a very intuitive explanation."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","In a convolutional neural network, is it necessary to increase the feature channels, as the network goes to deeper layers?","There are two main reasons for this: As you apply pooling, your data gets smaller and you can afford to have more channels, keeping the same amount of information but making it more relevant to your problem. Deeper layers have larger receptive fields and generally correspond to more specific features. Early layers learn things like lines while later layers learn much more complex features like faces. There are going to be a lot more of those complex features than there are simple features, so you want more channels to capture them all."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","In a convolutional neural network, is it necessary to increase the feature channels, as the network goes to deeper layers?","It’s mainly because in most CNN they are using pooling layers, which will reduce the size of you’re features maps by 4 (for strides of 2). At the same time you don’t want to create a dimensional bottleneck by compressing the features data too early in the CNN (typically what you would do in an auto-encoder). Then to keep a reasonable amount of data you just augment the number of features maps before pooling to compensate it."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why is the zero-centered activation function preferred in neural networks?","I don’t think that’s true anymore. The most-used activation functions nowadays are ReLU max(0,z) m & Leaky ReLU max(z,0.1∗z) m . This excludes the output layers. Another layer that I like is the PReLU max(z,alpha∗z) m and, a very less used, yet I found it better than all of the above in practice, is the SineReLU. This one is equal to z if z>0 z and ε (sin(z)−cos(z)) ("
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why is the zero-centered activation function preferred in neural networks?","Your premise is incorrect. One of the most frequently utilized activation functions is the rectifier (i.e. max(0,x) m ) and it is by no means zero centered and is an approximation of softplus (i.e. ln(exp(x)+1) l ) which is a bit like what real-life neurons do."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why is the zero-centered activation function preferred in neural networks?","Most of such activations are Gaussian normalized, which is a prefered property for inputs of neural nets."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","If a convolutional network reaches a high validation accuracy after few epochs, is the resulting model good?","I'm not sure what exactly you mean by “good model”, but as long as you divided your data set between training and testing data and have been checking accuracy on the validation data (from training data) and evaluated your model on the testing data (which you haven't seen while training) and still getting almost similar accuracy on the testing dataset, then I believe you should be using a callback to stop training. I'm not sure if this helps but that's what you do in order to avoid overfitting your model."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What is the meaning of inductive bias in machine learning?","I don’t want to sound like I am talking out my arse. But it’s a skewed data set that throws off the model I believe. If you have a bad sample and make a model around a bad sample when you finally get good data the model won’t work."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Does the input image size affect CNN's performance? For instance, is a CNN trained with (512*512) input perform better than being trained with (128*128)?","It improves accuracy, but decrease model speed. In my experience, even extend image resolution from 224x224 to 299x299 improves classification score for 5–10%(on multi class classification with ~100 classes). But, take into account, that all images should be more than 512 in width and 512 in height. In other way it is useless."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Is the Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti CUDA compatible and ready for machine learning training?","CUDA shouldn’t be the problem. One of the bigger problems you will run into sooner or later is the limited amount of VRAM. 6 GB sounds fine and some machine learning applications will definitely work but for serious work you should have at least 8 GB VRAM (or use cloud computing). But hey. For starting and learning the basics it’s good enough."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Is the Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti CUDA compatible and ready for machine learning training?","I don’t think the question should be Ready for Machine learning, but rather be is it capable. I would say yes, depending on the complexity of the machine learning and the complexity of the tasks you need it to learn and accomplish with little instruction (because we have it so that the machine can make a correct or close enough guess without much effort), but if your expectations surpass this level of complexity, I would say no."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Is the Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti CUDA compatible and ready for machine learning training?","Yes, it’s CUDA compatible but the memory and CUDA cores are not enough for training practical models in a realistic amount of time. If you really want a budget option, wait for the Ampere equivalent of the 1660 ti to come out. Tensor cores with fp32 FMA ops will give you a solid boost in both training and inference on the Ampere cards."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Is the Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti CUDA compatible and ready for machine learning training?","I have just a 1050 Ti and it works. It can even run a bunch of the Huggingface language models. I couldn’t use it to train them though :)"
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Is the Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti CUDA compatible and ready for machine learning training?","Machine learning you’d have to program. Any GPU can be used for that. The 1660Ti is a good GPU, which can get quite some work done. If you’re into continuously programming OpenCL code for machine learning, you’re probably better off with a slightly more expensive RTX 3070 or 3080, or the flagship. But for performing code now and then, even a GT 1030 will be much more powerful than an Nvidia Xavier NX or Nano."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Is the Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti CUDA compatible and ready for machine learning training?","Depends what you want to do with it. Yes you can train and create machine learning programs with a 1660ti. If its absurdly complex it may be better to get a different card."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Can decision trees handle categorical variable without preprocessing (eg. without changing to labels or hot encoders)?","Yes, that is exactly what they do. There is no need to one-hot-encode your categorical variables for use in a decision tree. Each node in the tree has one child node per value that its variable can take. However, if you are using Scikit Learn in Python you will find it is not able to cope with categorical data in this way. You choices then are to re-code or choose a tool that can do the job properly!"
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Can decision trees handle categorical variable without preprocessing (eg. without changing to labels or hot encoders)?","Yes, somewhat. Decision trees and their derivatives, including regression trees and tree ensembles like random forests, are surprisingly robust to categorical variables that are not processed as such. Much more so than linear models or neural nets. To understand why this happens, you can build intuition through the view that it's almost like decision trees treat all variables like categorical variables."

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What are the causes and possible solutions to always same binary class prediction in Convolutional Neural Network using Keras?","If your input dataset is imbalanced i.e. if most of the 5000 inputs are representing the same class, then, your model is likely to predict the same for the unseen data. The solution is to use a balanced dataset as input (with equal proportion of classes). If you are not able to create a balanced dataset due to lack of data from a particular class, another option is to re-weight the loss function to penalize the majority class. Here is a nice blog about this: Tensorflow — Dealing with imbalanced data – Fineighbor Blog ."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What are the causes and possible solutions to always same binary class prediction in Convolutional Neural Network using Keras?","I assume it is about classifying genuine or forgery signature. It may happen to predict all same classifications if the training data is imbalanced extremely. Or your genuine signature in dataset lacks intraclass variability may fail in training highly accurate model. http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2016/pdfs/276_Report.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00974.pdf In addition, image pre-process, such as removing background, inverting image, and normalization, before CNN training may help."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What are the causes and possible solutions to always same binary class prediction in Convolutional Neural Network using Keras?","The most common cause is : Error in code .

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How many iters or epochs do I need to finetune a pretrained model on a new dataset with parameters of certain layers initialized? How could I assign the learning rate?","There is no standard number of epochs/iterations. Generally, the loss keeps on reducing with more epochs. The validation loss decreases at first, but rises once the model starts to overfit. So the point where the validation loss is at its lowest is an ideal termination point."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How many iters or epochs do I need to finetune a pretrained model on a new dataset with parameters of certain layers initialized? How could I assign the learning rate?","Both learning rate and number of training epochs are hyperparameters which are to be fine-tuned, as in ordinary models."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How many iters or epochs do I need to finetune a pretrained model on a new dataset with parameters of certain layers initialized? How could I assign the learning rate?","It all depends on how much different or similar is the new dataset compared to pretrained dataset. Based on that you should follow your intutions on number of iterations ans start with that. After couple of iterations, you may judge the quality and accordingly change the epoch or other parameters for better results."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How should I use date as an input for a neural network? Is there any format that I should use for the date?","You use whatever format you want. It’s just data. Typically, it would be converted into an integer which is the number of days from an epoch date. Or, it might be a 64-bit integer, the number of 100ns units from January 1, 1600, 0:00. It doesn’t matter; to the DL network, it is just a number."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How should I use date as an input for a neural network? Is there any format that I should use for the date?","The format you use will depend very much on why the variable is important. Ideally use categorical data and ask do you need a category for each date, day of week, week count, month, year? The more you include the harder it is to generalise but if you miss an important category it can not learn that aspect. As with all neural projects think of what is the most efficient and informative way to present dates for your data to a human. Then use something similar to that."

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What is the meaning of flattening step in a convolutional neural network?","Flatten layers allow you to change the shape of the data from a vector of 2d matrixes (or nd matrices really) into the correct format for a dense layer to interpret. It’s simply allowing the data to be operable by this different layer type."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What may be the reasons for using linear activation function in neural networks?","Speed of execution is one factor as linear functions like relu are less computationally intensive. Many of the non linear activation also suffer from the vanishing gradient problem where the loss derivatives cease to update the weights during training. Techniques like dropout are used in conjunction using linear activation functions to reduce this risk."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What may be the reasons for using linear activation function in neural networks?","Training a neural network with only strictly linear activation functions (i.e. not piecewise linear like ReLU) is equivalent to doing simple linear regression. Therefore there is never a good reason to use linear activation functions. If your problem is linearly separable just use linear regression."

Have you ever faced this kind of problem in your machine learning/data science experience so far?","This is a common scenario but generally not a problem. Most datasets contain an awful lot of observations that add nothing to your model. Simply sampling your data will result in a model that is equally good being built in a fraction of the time. There are a few scenarios where you truly do need that extra data in the model. Many algorithms support processing training data in batches to achieve this. Incidentally, 4GB in 2019? The company that provided you this computer is wasting a lot of money forcing you to solve problems the slow way. Going to 32GB of RAM costs far less than the wages saved."

Convolution layer and subsampling layer do feature extraction, where as fully connected layers do classification based on the features by previous layer."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What happens in the fully connected layer in a convolutional neural network?","Hello, my friend It takes the output of the last pooling layer “the very high features inside the image” after the flattening process. it works with each pixel as input with corresponding weights to match the output to this input."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What happens in the fully connected layer in a convolutional neural network?","FC layers simply learns non-linear functions of features and classify images based on High level features. Fully connected layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in another layer. The flattened matrix goes through a fully connected layer to classify the images. The output from the convolutional layers represents high-level features in the data. While that output could be flattened and connected to the output layer, adding a fully-connected layer is a (usually) cheap way of learning non-linear combinations of these features."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What happens in the fully connected layer in a convolutional neural network?","Primarily, the fully connected layer does categorization. Where convolution layers are filters. They transform the data into something easier to categorize. Think of those convolutions as simplifying the input."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What happens in the fully connected layer in a convolutional neural network?","I’d like to think of a final Fully Connected Layer as a mapping/embedding from the feature maps (attention to the spatial correlation and feature description) to an N-dimensional vector space, where a given input x, represented by the set of its feature maps, is mapped to. Ultimately each image, if appropriately mapped, represents a signal point in the higher dimensional vector space that can make up clusters/surfaces/manifolds."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What happens in the fully connected layer in a convolutional neural network?","The fully connected layers of usually the last few layers of a CNN. These would act identical to the layers in a traditional deep neural network. The main difference is the inputs would be in the shape and form created by the earlier stages of the CNN. Therefore, what this means is that each of the neurons in the fully connected layers will over time capture elements of the input data that should allow it to then predict the correct Y value at the softmax layer."
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","What is the difference between Deconvolution, Upsampling, Unpooling, and Convolutional Sparse Coding?","The output and input of the FCN/deconvolutional network are of the same size, the goal of FCN or deconvolutional network/autoencoder in pixel labelling is to create a pixel wise dense feature map. The output of the unpooling(aka upsampling, is often done by the method you've mentioned) layer will be enlarged yet sparse feature maps, the following deconvolution layers will then densify these feature maps through convolution-like operations with multiple trainable filters. Hope that answers your question."

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why using sigmoid and tanh as the activation functions in LSTM or RNN is not problematic but this is not the case in other neural nets?","Commonly, sigmoid and tanh activation functions are problematic (gradient vanishing) in RNN especially when the training algorithm BPTT is utilized. In LSTM, because of the gates, the gradient vanishing problem does not exist. Before I give the details of gradient vanishing problem, I would like to know whether the author proposes the correct question. Thanks!"
"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Why using sigmoid and tanh as the activation functions in LSTM or RNN is not problematic but this is not the case in other neural nets?","Because the forget gate in LSTMs allow the gradient to stay stable."

Can you get a data science related job with only experience in Machine Learning?","Yes, you can work as a data scientist without deep learning, you don’t even need to know how machine learning works to do that. Of course, your options will be limited, but you can still use various tools from statistics to work with the data and get actionable insight. Machine learning can be good if you want to build a classifier or a predictor and you don't quite know which features in your data should be used to get the results. But not all tasks are like that."

"Deep Learning","Deep Learning","How do I interpret a high accuracy (82.44%) but an extremely low F1 score (0.259) in my deep learning model? How do I go about improving the F1 score?","This could indicate underfitting on an unbalanced dataset. Take a case of binary classification for example. You have 100 testing examples. 82 of them are from class A and the other 18 are from class B. Your model can achieve 82% accuracy simply by classifying A each time! Such is why the F1 score is so important in evaluating models on unbalanced datasets; it accounts for the performance of all classes. There are two things you may research to improve your model.

However, it is important to note that such a service would require a lot of data in order to be effective. Additionally, it is likely that the assessment would be based on user feedback rather than on any sort of objective measure."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","How can I use KNN for mixed data (categorical and numerical)?","Use one hot encoding for the categorical data. If you enumerated it then you would introduce a bias about which categories are “closer”. Consider the example of three categories, a, b and c. If you assigned them the value 1, 2 and 3 you would implicitly be assuming that category a is closer to category b than c in your feature space (distance 1 compared to distance 2)."

"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","What is the difference between time series and regression?","Time series is the word used to describe data which is ordered by time; example stock prices by date. Regression is the word used to describe a mathematical model which aims to check whether a variable, example, a man’s weight is dependent on some other variables, example, his height and the amount of rice he eats every day. A possible example where both these words are used is when you say, “I want to do a regression on a time series data”. The meaning of this is to check whether stock prices tomorrow are dependent on today’s stock prices plus some other variables."

"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Do I need to do feature scaling for simple linear regression?","No, it is not necessary, but recommended for regression techniques as well because it would help gradient descent to converge fast and reach the global minima. When number of features becomes large, it helps is running model quickly else the starting point would be very far from minima, if the scaling is not done in preprocessing."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Do I need to do feature scaling for simple linear regression?","Scaling of features can be very helpful: It can help in the faster convergence of the algorithm in case you are using Gradient Descent. It can make the analysis of coefficients easier.If your features differ in scale then this may impact the resultant coefficients of the model and it can be hard to interpret the coefficients. I follow it as a rule of thumb to use feature scaling for any algorithm that computes Euclidean distance between the features."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Do I need to do feature scaling for simple linear regression?","I suppose that you are not using any regularization (L1/L2 for example) because in this case scaling can affect solution.

Utilizing the biochemistry of cellular, bacterial, viral and corresponding components to improve or change future progeny of a species for specific traits. (i.e. GMO, aquaponics, environmental rehabilitation, energy, ect.) Bioinformatics = information science of biology and biotechnology. (i.e. computated analytical comparisons between DNA sequences.) There is a slew in applications of both biotechnology and bioinformatics that are changing the world."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","What's the difference between bioinformatics and biotechnology?","Both goes hand in hand. As others have posted, it depends in your inclination. Bioinformatics uses biological data and analyze it using computers. Because it is analysis, the subject includes algorithm learning, programming, statistics etc. Bioinformatics students are getting good internship opportunities in India and if you are one among those who are planning for study abroad for your masters, then don't think twice."

"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","What exactly is meant by shared weights in convolutional neural network?","Shared weights means probably exactly what you think it does! If you have two networks, and they share some weights, that means that when one network trains, it will update those weights. The second network will then use those same weights (and train them as well)."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","What exactly is meant by shared weights in convolutional neural network?","Short Answer: The learned filters at each layer (let’s say 3x3x3 filter) is scanned across the image (say 256x256x3), so every neighborhood of the image is processed/responded by the same learned filter. What this provides is the translation invariance. If you have a car in the image, whether this is in top-left or bottom-right, the filters (which learn to extract certain features) or produce a higher activation once they see a similar pattern that they learned regardless of the location of the feature, only outputting at that location"
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","How much RAM is recommended for machine learning?","It depends on the problem you want to solve. If you want to tackle AI problems using a human brain sized neural network with 10 14 10 synapses, you will need about a petabyte. If you want to simulate the evolution of humans, you will need 10 31 10 bits just to represent all the DNA on Earth."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","How much RAM is recommended for machine learning?","As much as you can reasonably afford. 8 GB is often insufficient for industry-scale machine learning. 16 GB is decent. 32 GB is better, but already starting to get pretty expensive. 64 GB is rarely seen on single machines unless there’s a particular need for it. That’s probably $1k+ in RAM alone. If you’re tinkering with machine learning on your own and are on the lookout for a PC, I would recommend 16 GB RAM as a good compromise unless money is not an issue."

"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Why does my own neural network give me the same output for different input sets?","Your network has high bais problem. You need to make your network more dense by adding more layers, and/or widening the existing layers. You also need to increase the size of your training data and make sure all data classes are there in approx. equal proportions. You have to determine the false negative and false positive rates. If either one of them becomes 100% then this is a sure indicator that your network is not functioning, and classifying all to a same class. There might be coding issues in your network code. Also verify the code."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Why does my own neural network give me the same output for different input sets?","I have the same problem before, and finally, I found it is because I didn’t shuffle the training set before train the model. This may cause overfitting because the model can only see the data with the same label in the last batch."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Why does my own neural network give me the same output for different input sets?","I faced the same problem several times before. It is usually related to the bias of your layers. You need to debug biases. What happens usually is your weights are too small(which can be ok) but your bias is not so your weights do not matter."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Why does my own neural network give me the same output for different input sets?","You’ve either written a bad neural net. Or, the net is not not trained on the new vocabulary of your data or you’ve set a constant to reproduce the same results. Not a thorough answer but things to think about."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","What is max pooling in convolutional neural networks?","Max Pooling In Max pooling we choose the maximum value within a matrix. The size of the matrix could be 2 X 2 or 3 X 3 also. Here is an image showing the max pooling of the reference image of 3 It is basically used to reduce the size of the image because the larger number of pixels contribute to more parameters which can involve large chunks of data. Thus we need less parameters such that a CNN can still identify the image. With max pooling size of the resultant image gets reduced and also retaining the image information.

"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","What is the temperature parameter in deep learning?","The temperature parameter is often used in multiclass classification to determine how “spiky” a probability distribution is. If the temperature is low, you get a spiky distribution, one with a single or a few prominent peaks. If the temperature is high, you get a flat distribution with no prominent peaks."

So, it is a research work which requires deep understanding of computer programming with great application skills."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Do AI and machine learning involve a lot of coding?","It can, and in the profession, it usually does. Cloud platforms and packages take a lot of the work out of implementing algorithms that already exist, though. More of it involves the math and domain knowledge these days than the coding. With access to a few good tutorials on a method, you can learn what you need to learn to code with a given package. Learning a new language might involve more. Coding an algorithm from scratch will involve a lot of coding, computer science knowledge, and mathematical expertise."

The difference is K-means is hard clustering and GMM is soft clustering as LDA. In most cases with LDA and GMM you will have better results than with K-means in topic detection, just because GMM and LDA better model the problem where single document may belong to several different topics."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Does Gradient Descent Algo always converge to the global minimum?","No. Not always. You can be assured a global solution in case of convex functions. Now for non-convex functions, many naive intuitions would suggest that global minima is impossible. That’s far from the truth. Many non-convex problems can also reach a global minima albeit with some amount of regularization. For example, the wirtinger flow algorithm can solve phase retrieval, a non convex problem"
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Does Gradient Descent Algo always converge to the global minimum?","it depend on function and stepsize. If the function is convex and the stepsize is choosed with condition that function strictly decrease, then gradient descent algorithm is converge to the global minimum."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Does Gradient Descent Algo always converge to the global minimum?","Nope it is no guarantee. Gradient descent is what is known as a local optimizer. IE it will tend to find the closest local minima from the starting point. It will only find the global minima if the starting point is nearby the minima."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Can I run multiple deep learning models on the same GPU?","GPU cycles don’t care. It’s a memory issue.

"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Can I run multiple deep learning models on the same GPU?","Not sure with OpenCL GPUs, but with NVIDIA GPUs, assuming that each model has enough memory to work with and that they are not sharing the same threads and memory blocks, you can run separate ML models within the same GPU. With CUDA code, it’s fairly simple to tell the kernel how many threads you need with each model/program."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","What is artificial intelligence? What are subjects if we want to study artificial intelligence?","Before studying AI, make sure to understand the limitations of AI: Scientists are unable to define intelligence in a natural way, as a set of natural laws. Not being based on natural laws of intelligence, AI is not intelligent by itself. As a consequence, AI — in general — is limited to perform repetitive tasks, and artificial neural networks — in particular — are limited to pattern recognition."

"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","What is a downsampling layer in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?","It's just... downsampling. If you have a 16x16 input layer, and apply 2:1 downsampling, you end up with a 8x8 layer. Each 'pixel' in the new layer represents 4 in the input layer, and in the typical implementation, the max of the 4 values is taken. Think about scaling an image down in resolution, except instead of taking the average of old pixels that map to the same new pixel, we take the max instead."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","What is a downsampling layer in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?","There are majorly two benefits to having the downsampling layer : 1) Reducing the number of parameters ensures higher computational speeds. 2) A layer such as max pooling layer or averaging layer ensures translational equivariance. This means that your output is tolerant to small translational changes in the input."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","What is a downsampling layer in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?","A downsampling layer helps to reduce the dimensionality of the features at cost of a some loss in information. This helps save computations. Average pooling, max pooling, global average pooling are some examples of downsampling layer. An alternative would be to use strides in the convolution layer to downsample."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Would using too many neighbors in the k-nearest neighbor (pattern) classification algorithm lead to overfitting, since it would smooth out the data?","The opposite, actually. More neighbors smooths out local weirdness, which is what causes lack of generalization. The more smoothing, the less local 'hiccups' in the model, and the more generalization. However, I've found some evidence that knn ensemble methods with varying k tend to do a lot better empirically on data than the simple knn methods (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1708/1708.02122.pdf)."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Would using too many neighbors in the k-nearest neighbor (pattern) classification algorithm lead to overfitting, since it would smooth out the data?","Using less neighbors would actually lead to overfitting. For example, consider a binary classifier with a clear nonlinear relationship. If there were outlying positive classified sample data point in a region that is generally negative, a k=1 k prediction for that region would evaluate positive as well as a result of overfitting (when we would want a negative prediction). Using a higher k k value would address this problem and have less variance."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Would using too many neighbors in the k-nearest neighbor (pattern) classification algorithm lead to overfitting, since it would smooth out the data?","As the number of neighbours tends to zero, models gets complicated and then poorly generalising to new data is what causes to overfitting. which can be prevented by regularising the regression coefficient."
"Machine Learning","Machine Learning","Would using too many neighbors in the k-nearest neighbor (pattern) classification algorithm lead to overfitting, since it would smooth out the data?","Smoothing is typically a desirable property for generalization. While it technically depends on the characteristics of the dataset, increasing k should reduce over-fitting but once k is too large the smoothing effect you intuited results in decreased variance which will effect overall performance negatively."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","How do you write a program that converts a number to a letter of the alphabet (in C)?","C uses ASCII character encoding where each character is associated with a number. The code range for small letters of the alphabet is 97–122 (97=’a’, 98=’b’,…, 122=’z’). So if you want to convert a number to a letter you want to bring it into that range. You can do so as follows: int number;  scanf('%d', &number);   char letter = number % 26 + 97;   printf('%c', letter);  The mod operation ‘% 26’ brings the number into the range [0, 25], while the addition brings the number into the range [97, 122] i.e. a small letter of the alphabet."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","How do you write a program that converts a number to a letter of the alphabet (in C)?","Well, you can do it easily if you know ASCII code for alphabets. For example: int i = 10;  char c = i + 'a';  now simply print c. The answer will be k."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","How do you write a program that converts a number to a letter of the alphabet (in C)?","C has an implicit int-char conversion, you can literally set a character to a number without even casting it. int asciiAInt = 65;  char letterA = asciiAInt;  The value of “letterA” in the above example will be ‘A’."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","How do you write a program that converts a number to a letter of the alphabet (in C)?","Just to add a bit to Max’s already good answer… Quite often when you are asked for number to letter of the alphabet they do not want to start with 65 so… add to the value.

"Algorithms","Algorithms","What is the time and space complexity of brute force algorithm?","This question is unanswerably vague. You might as well be asking “how much water is in a lake” or “how tall is a mountain”. The time and space complexity of a brute-force algorithm depends on the problem that it's intended to solve. Moreover, different approaches to brute-forcing a problem might optimize for either time complexity or space complexity, likely at the expense of the other."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","What is the time and space complexity of brute force algorithm?","As you don’t tell us how the input is related to the search space, all we can do is tell you the complexity in terms of the search space. The brute force algorithm will be O(N) time and O(N) space where N is the size of the search space. Note that in many cases the size of the search space is exponentially related to the size of the input."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","What is the time and space complexity of brute force algorithm?","Here is an example. How long does it take to sort N integers in ascending order? If you use a bubble sort, it is O(N**2) If you use heapsort it is O(N log N) By contrast, brute force could look like this: Generate all N! permutations on N elements. then Reorder the N integers using that permutation If the result is sorted, we are done This has a most remarkable complexity of O( N * N! ). This is the kind of difference you can see between brute force algorithms and more sophisticated algorithms that can collect information from earlier failures to radically shorten the computation time."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","How do you reverse an average number of a numbers without the numbers?","You can’t. Well, not accurately, at least. If given the average of two numbers, x x and y y , there are an infinite number of values for x x and y y . Say, for example, you were given the number 2 2 as the average of two numbers. Some possibilities are; 3 and 1 3 4 and 0 4 5 and −1 5 There’s an obvious pattern here. From this, we can conclude that there an an infinite number of possibilities as to what x x and y y can be, given the average. With more than two numbers, the same applies."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","How do you reverse an average number of a numbers without the numbers?","It's fairly easy. Given the mean and standard deviation, I can provide a set of numbers meeting those criteria pretty well instantly, via mental arithmetic. It won't correspond exactly with the original numbers, of course, but will satisfy the stated criteria. For example, 4 numbers with mean of 3.5 and SD of 1.5 = 2, 2, 5, 5."
"Algorithms","Algorithms","How do you reverse an average number of a numbers without the numbers?","Do what without what now? It’s kind of like unmixing paint. You need to know a lot more than just the average to reverse engineer the original numbers. If I tell you the average of my set of numbers was 5, I could have started with a set of just one number (5, obviously) or 100 numbers. Some of the numbers could be negative. Some could be non-integers. There’s literally an infinite number of possible sets for a given average. To narrow it down, we’d need the size of the set, its domain and range, its median, its mode… and I think all that still wouldn’t be enough."

If all you want is the final sequence of (decimal) numbers in a string, (?:\d+)(?!.*\d) will do that. That regex sets up a noncapturing group of one or more digits (\d+), then matches only when the string contains no additional digits.

After that, I can either Ctrl+Z or make any change to any cell. Is there a way to delete the entire array?","Short answer: Highlight all cells with the array formula, and press the Delete key. Background: Arrays are powerful formulas but require the formula to be entered in at least two cells. Array formulas are created and modified by entering the formula and then pressing CTRL and SHIFT and ENTER, instead of just enter. Part of their power is that individual cells cannot be modified, they must be done collectively. They tend to perform better than regular formulae."

"Algorithms","Algorithms","What does front=rear=null and front=rear=-1 in queue of data structures in C++ mean?","If the front value equal the rear value it implies the queue is empty. The value could mean many things depending on how the queue in implimented"
"Algorithms","Algorithms","Which of the following statements is true about recursion, ‘recursive functions can hog a lot of memory and cause system crashes’ or ‘all Python functions are recursive in nature’?","A recursive function is one that can call itself. If that is done unbounded and to no end then yes, it will crash the program it is running in since it will break its local stack eventually. Unless it was part of the operating system it will most likely not cause an OS crash. Since Python supports recursion every function has the capability to call itself and thus be recursive. But if it doesn't do that either directly or indirectly it is not a recursive function."
